5378,2,I think people should take books off the shelf because or someones miss understanding. An author will write about something he or she wants to you can't change that all you can really do is write them a letter about how you feel about there topic and their book thats all you can do really. Some people will write thier songs on how they feel about people or how they feel about someone that they lost you take that affensive then I don't understand why you would take something like that affensive mybe you take a word wrong or something else. Mybe you don't like the song then don't listen to it. You can't really change anyone writes about or directs if a movie has a rated sign on it then mybe you shouldn't watch it. People take movies wrong all the time and then they tell people it wasn't any good well let them find out for themselfs don't set there and say something bad abou tsomething because someone might like that movie just because you didn't dosen't mean any thing. When someone writes an article about something they arn't tryen to hurt someones feelings or tryen to bad mouth something some writers write about how they feel or how someone looked or a fashion show or something that happend you can't change thier feelings and you can't change how they feel all you can do is like I sayed write that person or directior or a auother a letter tellin them how you feel about it it really dosen't mean they are going to change it.

5380,2,"Removing all books, music, movies, and magazines that contain offensive writting out of libraries is not right. If we did that then we wouldn't have alot of books in libraries or not as many as we have now. Here is my opinion about it. We all know that alot of music have offensive material found in it. But if it only have a few offensive material found in it then I don't see a problem with it. My opinion is the same way for books. If there is only a few problems found in it related to offensive writting then I think the book is fine and it can stay in the library. For example, if a book or movie has alot of offensive stuff found in it and says an offensive word in it alot, then I think it shouldn't be on the shelfs. But if it only contains a few bad words in the writting then I think it is fine for it to be on the shelfs. Same for movies and magazines too because most the time, at least one of those are going to have something that is offensive in it. From my own experience I can say that I have gone to a library before and found a book with offensive writting in it. Parents most likely have the biggest concern about their children finding one of these books or finding a movie with offensive writting in it but most of the time books and movies that have the most offensive material in it is for adults or older teenagers anyways. Just think about it, what would your library look like if all the offensive books, movies, music, and magazines were pulled off the shelfs? Most likely a lot of those things would be taken out and you wouldn't be able to check them out anymore. This is why I don't think having offensive material in books, music, movies, and magazines is a big deal",7782,7783.0,Removing books  music  movies  magazines contain offensive writting libraries right  If would nt alot books libraries many  Here opinion  We know alot music offensive material found  But offensive material found I nt see problem  My opinion way books  If problems found related offensive writting I think book fine stay library  For example  book movie alot offensive stuff found says offensive word alot  I think nt shelfs  But contains bad words writting I think fine shelfs  Same movies magazines time  least one going something offensive  From experience I say I gone library found book offensive writting  Parents likely biggest concern children finding one books finding movie offensive writting time books movies offensive material adults older teenagers anyways  Just think  would library look like offensive books  movies  music  magazines pulled shelfs  Most likely lot things would taken would nt able check anymore  This I nt think offensive material books  music  movies  magazines big deal
5381,2,"Censorship in libraries should be limited to an extent where there should be no offensive material found in books, movies, music, or magazines. The offensive material should be taken off the library shelves if it truly offends any person. This library material someone find it offensive but others find it as good information or resource. A person might read certain information and consider it offensive. If found offensive that person should take action and demand for it to be taken off. The offensive material found in an library needs to be taken off. According to Katherine Paterson, any person has the right to remove any book from a shelf that is found offensive. This means people have the power to feel the need of removing offensive material. Offensive material found in libraries should be immediately removed from shelves because it can protect any person being offended. It can protect someone from being humiliated or felt out of place for a simple offensive remark. Also it is a person's duty to take action and demand to remove a book from a shelf that is found offensive. Even if a person not getting offended but noticing it offends others, that person needs to step up as a human being and help those being offended.

5382,2,"Dear Katherine Paterson. There are alot of people that belong to libraries across the globe. The librarie has such kinds of materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., to look from. If all of us had the right to remove one book from the shelf, because their offensive to people, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else, then the whole librarie will be empty. Libraries have alot of books, such as fictional and nonfictional, childrens, sports, autobiographys, etc. I bet that there is alot of people that would remove books, music, magazines, and movies from the shelf because their found offensive to people. I think that music now a days are not appropriete. Music that children and teens listen to now a days have some negative meanings to them, such as sex, drugs, money, getting high, foul langauge, and racism. These all can teach bad things to children thinking that its ok to have premature sex before marriage, do drugs cause it makes you feel good inside, etc. Music can change a persons life around. When people hear the music that they enjoy it ussauly has some of the following above. A big problem is magazines. Magazines are just a ton of gossip about celeberties, athletes, and ordinary people just like you. Some of the popular magazines are the sports illistrated, and the biggest one of all peoples magazine. Peoples magazine deals with celeberties, movie critics, etc. Our world as we know it, doesnt want to hear about the good things, but the bad things that people have done, this is why peoples magazine is so popular to this day. If i kyle, saw my children reading this i would not allow them to look at this stuff because its lies and gossip. For example, if you were to use 'wikipeada' for a souce on your world history paper. You can find great facts on what your looking up, but all you are getting is lies about the topic. its just the same as if children reading it, sticking the information in thier prescious minds because they dont understand whats right or wrong. Even tho libraries have materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines etc. Some of these should be taken off the shelfs cause they are truly offensive to alot of young children and young adults",7786,7787.0,Dear Katherine Paterson  There alot people belong libraries across globe  The librarie kinds materials  books  music  movies  magazines  etc  look  If us right remove one book shelf  offensive people  also exactly right everyone else  whole librarie empty  Libraries alot books  fictional nonfictional  childrens  sports  autobiographys  etc  I bet alot people would remove books  music  magazines  movies shelf found offensive people  I think music days appropriete  Music children teens listen days negative meanings  sex  drugs  money  getting high  foul langauge  racism  These teach bad things children thinking ok premature sex marriage  drugs cause makes feel good inside  etc  Music change persons life around  When people hear music enjoy ussauly following  A big problem magazines  Magazines ton gossip celeberties  athletes  ordinary people like  Some popular magazines sports illistrated  biggest one peoples magazine  Peoples magazine deals celeberties  movie critics  etc  Our world know  doesnt want hear good things  bad things people done  peoples magazine popular day  If kyle  saw children reading would allow look stuff lies gossip  For example  use wikipeada  souce world history paper  You find great facts looking  getting lies topic  children reading  sticking information thier prescious minds dont understand whats right wrong  Even tho libraries materials  books  music  movies  magazines etc  Some taken shelfs cause truly offensive alot young children young adults

5384,2,"My view of censorship in libraries are that usually if it is found offenssive to someone, then it should be moved to another part of the library, that way the people who are not offended do not get upset. This way people who find it offensive would not have to worry about it getting in to the hands of their children. In some cases people find helpful information offensive, but I think that if the information is helpful then it should not have to be moved. The library should not have extremely offensive materials. Some books have a few bad language words in them. That does not always make them offensive. It goes the same for movies and magazines, too. The movies that make people feel offensive are probably not the movies you would find in a library, but if they are in the library, then they should have their own section of the library for those who are not offended by them. If the people who are offended do not like this idea then they could just stay out of the particular section of the library. They would not have to go to that section to find a book, movie, magazine, or etc.. This would also help the younger children from seeing some materials that they are not ready to see. Books, movies, magazines, etc. are not always offesive to everyone, so if they get removed from the library because someone finds them offensive, then their would bairly be any books at the library. People have different beliefs about what is and what is not offensive. So obviously the library would have some trouble choosing which books stay and which ones are removed; they should be aware of people who are offended by some of the books, movies, magazines, etc.. The library would not have to get rid of any books this way. I have spent pleanty of time at the public library in town. At our library they do not usually have offensive materials, but if they do then the materials that are offensive have their own section. It is in the adult section instead of the teen or children's department. The public library in town has three sections that have books, magazines, and sometimes movies that are appropriate for the various age groups that go there. I have noticed that there has almost never been an inoppriate book, magazine, or movie in any department that it did not belong in. When I read books there are only a few bad language words in them, because I look in the teen department and find books that are not only appropriate; but they are not offensive to my age group, they are not bad books, and they can be very informational books. Therefore books in libraries that are found offensive to some, might not be offensive to others. If people find a book offensive, then they should let their library know so that the library could move it to a different section or department of the library. I do not think that the books should have to be taken out of the library, because for others the same books could be informational. The censorship in libraries would be fine if they had the offensive books, movies, magazines, or etc. in another section, so those who are offended do not get upset and those who are not offended get to continue having their materials.",7790,7791.0,My view censorship libraries usually found offenssive someone  moved another part library  way people offended get upset  This way people find offensive would worry getting hands children  In cases people find helpful information offensive  I think information helpful moved  The library extremely offensive materials  Some books bad language words  That always make offensive  It goes movies magazines   The movies make people feel offensive probably movies would find library  library  section library offended  If people offended like idea could stay particular section library  They would go section find book  movie  magazine  etc  This would also help younger children seeing materials ready see  Books  movies  magazines  etc  always offesive everyone  get removed library someone finds offensive  would bairly books library  People different beliefs offensive  So obviously library would trouble choosing books stay ones removed  aware people offended books  movies  magazines  etc  The library would get rid books way  I spent pleanty time public library town  At library usually offensive materials  materials offensive section  It adult section instead teen children s department  The public library town three sections books  magazines  sometimes movies appropriate various age groups go  I noticed almost never inoppriate book  magazine  movie department belong  When I read books bad language words  I look teen department find books appropriate  offensive age group  bad books  informational books  Therefore books libraries found offensive  might offensive others  If people find book offensive  let library know library could move different section department library  I think books taken library  others books could informational  The censorship libraries would fine offensive books  movies  magazines  etc  another section  offended get upset offended get continue materials

5386,2,"Libraries today are the source of our information. I think that they should be carful on what they have, because of what they provide us today. Libraries are there if you have hobbies such as reading. Libraries today have have as much of information as they can get to today. Although libraries are the source of information today they should be limited on the stuff they get such as movies. Libraries can provide hobbies such as reading, listening to music, waching movies, and seeing on what is going on today. People who like to read tend to help people when they need help on work such as writing a book. People do alot for hobbies, cause they have nothing better to do. Watching movies can be fun, but boring as well. Magazines can tell whats going on with our hisory, famos people, and science. Libraries should be omited on some of the stuff that parents don't want their children seeing. Parents should be responsible to know what the libraries have in their facilities. Not just the parents but the facilities as well, because children or teens need a source of information, and should be posted on what they can provide to them. Remember libraries is the source of information today. They can provide any information you as a parent or worker should know the library before sending your own child in there. Not just that, but libraries are a good source if you have hobbies such as reading.

5387,2,"If I ever saw a book that I thought to be offensive I would probably ask that it be put on or in a certin shelf where the general public could not acces unless they went to that particular shelf or asked about it.

5388,2,I think that if materials in libraires are offencive they should br removed. A small child could get a hold of it and then the library will be in trouble. If the material is for education then it should be in a seperate room away from others who don't need the material like children. If the library wants to keep the material then they should have certain paper work on the material saying that they can have it. Online users should be restricted from offencive material unless they have a certain password or code allowing them to get the information. People who use the resorces in a wrong way should be cut off from the password and not recieve another one. You see people getting in trouble all the time for things like this on their computers or phones. It should be stopped. So for all the people who agree with me saying that offencive materials in libaries should be handled with care and not be put in wrong hands of people who could use the material in a sence of matter in which it shouldn't be used in. All librabies should have a cetain area or room for the material. If its online then a certain password should be instated. This is for the saftey of children and people who use it in a wrong matter.

5389,2,"Have you ever felt the need of protecting your child or children from grabbing a book of a shelf? It doesn't have to be a book, it could be a magazine, a movie, or even the type of music they would listen to. There is a lot of parents that are concerned about that. Children might not have the appropiate age to view those kind of materials and their parents want to make sure they won't go and do something like that. For example, if children do not have the appropiate age, there is no reason for them to be looking at that certain stuff. Viewing that material is not right and parents should take authority over that situation by talking to their children about that. Children should obey, be honest, and respect what their parents have to say to them. That is one way on how things should work during that situation. If kids don't obey and go around doing what they feel, there will be no trust or respect between parents and children. This topic is really series because children can access anything through a library or internet. They could be doing something not appropiate which can cause them to get in trouble if there parenst find out. Of course they will hide it from them and parents might never find out. That is one reason why parents are now doing everything possible to remove everything not appropiate for children. Parents now want to take over and have the authority by demanding and making the decision of removing certain materials that are not appropiate for children. I truely do not agree with this decision coming from the parents because of several reasons. One, why should libraries vanish their materials just because their children might be able to get a hold of a book that is not for them? There is no reason for libraries to remove their materials. If children are doing something wrong, parents should take cotrol over that by both parents thingking and talking it through. They can block internet at home from certain sites, lock television channels, and maybe have a talk to the librarian about kids checking books that are only permitted for them by making sure children only have access to appropiate material. This could be the solution to this problem, and that way there won't be anything removed that other people can be interested in. In conclusion, removing items from libraries won't be the solution. Thinking and talking it through by finding a solution would probably be the best way because there is other people that can access materials children can not.

5390,2,"I believe that certain materials should not be taken off the shelf unless the material like a book for example has been voted to be removed from shelves, unless it is at a school library. There are many people who believe that yes, book and such should be taken off the shelves if they are taken offensive by someone, but the thing is that not everyone take offence to it and could benefit from it. If something were to be removed, that it should be voted on to see how many people think it is offensive or not. If more than half the votes think the material is offensive, then it should be taken off the shelves. I personally have never read anything that has offended me in the past, so i can not say that I have had the experience of being offended like that. I personally believe that some people take things too harshly and they should try and look at it from a different perspective besides their own. I say that yes people could be harmed from reading or watching something, but not everyone will be, and thoes people could benefit from reading or watching it. I believe in order for certain materials to be removed from shelves, that they must first be voted on by a certain number of random people to see if they find it offensive. If more than half of them think that it is offensive, then it should be taken off the shelves, but if it is not then it should be left alone. Not everything needs to be removed by shelves just because a certain individual or a few people think that it is offensive, because then the rest of the people around them could not read or watch it and possibly benefit from it. The only way that i would say that voting is not needed, is in a school library. If the school were not a high school, then offensive materials not need to be voted on to be removed from shelves. We do not need for children under the ages of thirteen to be exposed to certain things like that. They are too young to understand what it might be saying, and take it the wrong way and it could harm them mentally. I say that unless the library is in a middle school or lower, then a vote is not needed for certain materials to be removed from shelves. In conclusion, I belive that most libraries should have to take a vote in order for certain materials like books, music, movies, or magazines to be removed from shelves. People who not find the material offensive could benefit from it.

5392,2,"Everyone has their own opinion and everyone has a right to state it. In a library there are hundreds and thousands of books and every one of them is about something different, has different morals and has a different meaning. People should not be able to act upon their opinion by taking it off the shelf. If people would do this then it will be going against someone elses opinion, which isn't fair to them. Almost every library has children sections with only books for children. These sections do not contain any explicit books or movies. There's not a reason for the other books to be removed from the shelves when there are sections designated for children. Although, some libraries have adult entertainment books and movies but they are usually stored in a different area that people under eighteen are not allowed to enter. It is your choice to open a book and read a page or rent a movie, you aren't forced too. If it looks explicit don't open it or rent it. If you have strong morals then there are websites for people to go to and read reviews about how good something is. It gives a lot of detail on violence, language, sexual content and positive and negative elements. These websites are open to everybody and uf you aren't sure about something, use them. Not everyone agrees with a certain movie. Someone could find it boring, another could find it funny, and someone else could find it crude. Movies are out there for anyone to see, so if you want to go see it, go see it. If you think it's going to end up being crude or boring, don't. No one is entitled to see a certain movie or read a certain book, so if it goes against your beliefs and opinions then that's the fact but that doesn't mean that it goes against someone elses and the truth is someone else probably enjoys it. It wouldn't be fair to take that joy away from someone else just because you think it's wrong.

5393,2,"In libraries around the world there are millions of books. There isn't one library that has the same exact movies, books, or magazines. There is a different variety of books at each individual library. The libraries could be similar but not the same. I believe that any material that is in the library is there for a reason because it is either educational, popular, or required. First, there is a lot of educational books in libraries. Libraries carry books on history. For example, you can go to a library and borrow a book about the There isn't just that one book on the though. There could be fifteen or twenty books on it. You can learn about what the soldiers went through in the years of the There is also books on politics. You could learn about what happens in political positions. Each political position does a different thing to be successful. These examples you would have to read about to find out everything. You couldn't just watch television or jump right into politics to learn about it. Second, there is all kinds of popular music in the world. The library is wanting people in the library so they bring in some of the poplular music that is currently out. There is always going to be something that is very popular and that is what people want. In order to bring new people into the library they bring in that music. It is what people want to see in their libraries so they can go there and relax with some music after a busy day. Third, there be books, magazines, or movies that are required for each library to carry. A library might be required to carry a certain number of history books or childrens' books. A particular library have subscriptions to magazines and that is what they put on the shelves for people to read because it is current and could be very popular. There is also movies that libraries carry. They could be required to have movies of all ratings in their inventory. There could be many requirements for a library that are unknown to the general public. In conclusion, there are many different varities of books in the world. If you don't approve of a certain type then don't read it or listen to it. You could go to another library that is close by and look at their selection of books, magazines, or music. There isn't one library that has the same exact inventory. This allows variety and makes your chances of finding something you want higher.

I'm in high school and some books are not aloud in are school but we have a program that lets people read books that are usely not aloud in are program. I think it really depends on what grade your in for the censor level to be high or low. When I think about serious censorship I think of diary and that book is completely not aloud in and you can even go to jail for it if you have it in your house or car or even on you at any time. Now that is serious censorship.

Now what i don't understand is your going to let someone two years under me read it but i cant? Now I am in high school and not much is censored but some books still are like the twillight series they baned that in two school and those school districts are next to us but they didn't in our school because they know that you can go and see it at a movie so whats the point in reading about sex if you can just go and see it in the movies. The books that they bane here are for a pretty good reason so i have faith in my library thay they wont censor anything that shouln't deserve it. When i think of censored books I think of books that shouldn't have been writen in the first place or should have a age for the reader.

5395,2,"Freedom of is the key to any well-rounded person. As a child, we belive what are parents tell us, but then, as we grow older, we learn from reading and watching movies. Everything we are exposed to helps us develope as human beings. Although some materials not be appropriate for all viewers, an individual should not be allowed to withhold information from others. As a parent, there are several things you don't want your child to be exposed to, weither a violent movie, elicit images in a magazine, or vived details described in a book. The parent has the responsability to shelter their children from the outside world until they are able to fully understand what they are exposed to. This is not to say that the library is compleatly off the hook. The library has the ethical responsablility of putting 'adult materials' in a different section, away from the children's books. Perhaps the library should even put an age limit on being able to check out the more mature material, but is not neccissary to take away anything from a public library. People have a right to see the content of what is being produced in their society, unless somehow violates another individual's constitutional rights. In the news, we often read about communist governments censoring the internet, and other forms of media, in an attempt to keep the citizens unaware of what is going on in the government and the rest of the world. For example, in youtube, facebook, and meny other media sites are blocked in hopes of keeping the citizens unaware of the country's situation. This helps to prevent rebellions against the government, as well as keeping the citizens uneducated about world issues. Although taking away what seems to be an unimortant book from your local library, things can escilate quickly. Being exposed to meny different points of view, no matter how misguided you think they my be is a good thing. So othen, we are caught in out own world, forgetting that not everyone thinks like us. Things that seem worthless to us, others find enjoyment and meaning in them. like that old saying, '@CAPS3 man's trash is another man's treasure.' is the same way with these books and movies. You should not be so quick to toss them out becasue we can all learn someting from them. As readers, we need to learn to be more open minded. If you are able to see different people's point of view, then you are more likely to appreciate what you are reading or watching. Althought some materials not be appropriate for all viewers, an individual should not be allowed to withold infromation from others.

I believe that the '@CAPS2 is still in affacive, and its a '@CAPS2 So i think that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken off the self if they are offensive. Everything that has ever been written or filmed or taped probably has some offensiveness to somebody. So if we were to take everything 'off the shelves' that offended anyone we would have nothing left 'on the shelves.' personal experiance goes directly to what i listed above. Everything someone says will offend someone is some way, we have to learn to get over it. That thing that that person is not always going directly toward you. So taking away everything that is offending someone is not the answer. If we do that, we will have nothing. And that does too become offending. I strongly agree what Katherine Paterson is saying. An observation i have made is that its the and people are cruel. The more we let them know it hurts, the more the hurt us. So the crying about the offensive books, movies, music, magazines and taking them away is not the answer. People will just rebel and do more offensive things, in opinion.

5399,2,Have you ever found a book to be offensive? Have you ever wanted to simply get rid of the book so that no one else will read it? If you have participated in banning a book or other material then you have promoted censorship. limits what others can do and imposes your own opinions onto the rights of another person. Censoship is never a good idea as it limits free speech. said '...If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' statement is true because once you begin to restrict acess to media the line between what is acceptable and what is not can become blurred. Is it alright to remove a book if one person is opposed to it or does it need to be a group? How do you decide which books cannot be read by patrons? Once you remove any book that any person has an issue with there will be no books remaining to be read. There are many narrow minded people in the world. People will take offense to a book simply because it depicts a life that is different from their own. People will oppose a book for using colloqial language or touching on controversial issues. The books that people find offensive can often give insight into groups contrary to our own. These books educate us about different societies and lifestyles that we not otherwise have known about. By prohibiting a book or other reading material knowledge on the subject becomes limited and the people doing the banning are hurt by the scarcity of available knowledge. I am fortunate to have been told only one time that I was not allowed to read a book. occured as a result of my mother reading the book and deeming that some of the material was not age appropriate and was very graphic. I have not read the book and I do not have a problem with that. came in the form of a parent addressing their daughter on what they would prefer them not to read. My mother did not attempt to impose her opinions on anyone else. If my mother had begun a petition to remove the book from local stores and libraries I would have been strongly opposed to her actions. She only told me that she would prefer that I not read the book. Censorship in any form is a horrible act. People imose their own oppinions in a way that can eclipse other's rights. Any time that one person's actions endanger the rights of another person there is a problem. These actions also limit the knowledge aailable to the people and can allow misconceptions to remain intact.

5400,2,"Censorship in libraries is a controversial topic. As an avid reader myself, the freedom of choosing any book I desire is a right that I appreciate. While some materials such as music, movies, and magazines could be considered offensive or innapropriate, I do not think censorship should be enforced in libraries for various reasons. Music, writing, and the like are all forms of expression and we have the right to express ourselves, as well as the right to view others' expressions without censorship, and if a material is truly that bad, why is it in the library in the first place? Censorship would only cause more problems. Reading books, listening to music, watching movies, or skimming through magazines are all activities that humans turn to for relaxation or expression. We can choose things we relate to and identify with, or things that are on the opposite end of the spectrum so that we can better understand a topic. Censorship could possible take away the ability to do these things, because if an item is deemed offensive, that is all based on opinion. What is offensive to one person not be to the next. The need to express ourselves and have our thoughts known is a desire that most human beings feel. The right to view each others' expression is another desire that goes hand in hand. A library is a place where a person can privately research a topic they are interested in. Censorship could hinder that ability if, for example, teens under the age of are no longer allowed to check out informational books on drug use because it might spark an interest in them. Or if children are prohibited from listening to certain genres of music because it might influence their behaviors. I find that having the ability to check out anything I please is not only helpful, but a freedom we take advantage of. Faced with the idea of censorship I realize how much it means to be able to choose something simple as a book to read. Censorship in libraries should not be enforced simply because children 'might' be affected in a negative way. The odds are, they won't be. Another reason censorship seems silly to me is if a material is really all that bad, how did it end up in a library in the first place? If an item is deemed offensive to the point that it needs to be censored I do not believe it should be in a public library. If a child shows interest in checking out something considered offensive, perhaps a parent should be involved, but other than that, we should be able to choose what we wish. Everyone is affected differently by different rates of offensiveness. We all have different opinions and are biased, like it or not. Censoring books might solve some problems, but it would cause even more than it fixed. Simply put, there is no way to make everyone happy, but the current situations in libraries today keeps the most people the happiest. Censoring the materials found in a library is not a good idea. We all have a right to check out materials we are interested in, for our various reasons. Music and writing are two huge forms of human expression that have different levels of offensive aspects, but should still be able to be viewed by whoever so chooses. To be offended is all based on how a person reacts and their opinions, which why it seems wrong to me that a library should be censored based on one person or one collective group's opinion, when so many other opinions exist. It is impossible to find a solution that pleases everyone in any scenario. In Katherine Paterson's quote, she makes a point about if one person can take a book off the shelf, everyone else has that right, which would leave no books left for anyone. Censoring would just start a domino effect of censoring not only in libraries, but everywhere, eventually eliminating every kind of free expression out there. Censorship would only create more problems and more issues. which is why I believe it should not be enforced in libraries.",7822,7823.0,Censorship libraries controversial topic  As avid reader  freedom choosing book I desire right I appreciate  While materials music  movies  magazines could considered offensive innapropriate  I think censorship enforced libraries various reasons  Music  writing  like forms expression right express  well right view others  expressions without censorship  material truly bad  library first place  Censorship would cause problems  Reading books  listening music  watching movies  skimming magazines activities humans turn relaxation expression  We choose things relate identify  things opposite end spectrum better understand topic  Censorship could possible take away ability things  item deemed offensive  based opinion  What offensive one person next  The need express thoughts known desire human beings feel  The right view others  expression another desire goes hand hand  A library place person privately research topic interested  Censorship could hinder ability  example  teens age longer allowed check informational books drug use might spark interest  Or children prohibited listening certain genres music might influence behaviors  I find ability check anything I please helpful  freedom take advantage  Faced idea censorship I realize much means able choose something simple book read  Censorship libraries enforced simply children might  affected negative way  The odds  wo nt  Another reason censorship seems silly material really bad  end library first place  If item deemed offensive point needs censored I believe public library  If child shows interest checking something considered offensive  perhaps parent involved   able choose wish  Everyone affected differently different rates offensiveness  We different opinions biased  like  Censoring books might solve problems  would cause even fixed  Simply put  way make everyone happy  current situations libraries today keeps people happiest  Censoring materials found library good idea  We right check materials interested  various reasons  Music writing two huge forms human expression different levels offensive aspects  still able viewed whoever chooses  To offended based person reacts opinions  seems wrong library censored based one person one collective group s opinion  many opinions exist  It impossible find solution pleases everyone scenario  In Katherine Paterson s quote  makes point one person take book shelf  everyone else right  would leave books left anyone  Censoring would start domino effect censoring libraries  everywhere  eventually eliminating every kind free expression  Censorship would create problems issues  I believe enforced libraries

When running the towns, compermise by saying, if many of people dissagree with the content, take the disterbance off the shelves. The book, movie, magazine, music and many more things have the potential to offend the viewers. Whatever the content be, it include talking about their past and cause them to have a flashback of what has occured to them or someone close to them. The content also subscribe nude picture, sexual talk, things in this nature will give the community the reason on not approving the book, magazine, etc. Allowing these distractions to be removed would help prevent some of the way the community approaches things.

If you see a warning on them, and you are easily offended by crude language or scenes you should already know not to get them.

5404,2,"Racial slurs, cruel names, and rude comments, all things that should be taken out of a library. Young children should not be allowed to read things like that. People in the US are rude enough as it is, and for younger children to read that, they thinks its alright to say certain things that they read. Parents don't understand why their kids act the way that they do, but in my opinion its they media. What they watch and what they see on the internet, and even what they read. Many books are good to read, but there are some that say some crude things about certain races, they'll call a certain race a name, and have comments about that ethnicity, and when children read that then they think it's fine to repeat it to certain people. Every one is the same, and some books that are in libraries say differently. They should not be there for little kids to read, or any one at all Movies that kids watch with foul language and discrimination against against a certain group of people is another reason i think kids act so bad these days. They see how people act on movies, and since it is a movie they think its the cool thing to do and the right thing to do, but in all reality; it's not. When they watch a movie with violence they think its okay to go out and start a fight. Or they see something cool that they want to try and it gets them in a lot of trouble. I think if all violent movies with vulgar languages were taken off the library shelf, kids would have more respect for other ethnicites and stop being rude to people who aren't the same color or religion. The music kids are starting to listen to has some really vulgar, nasty words. Some music is alright for them to listen to, but there is just some music that should be taken off the shelf. All these younger kids go around quoting things that they here from a rap song, and their parents will still let them listen to it, but they wonder what happened to their child. They listen to the words and start to understand what it means, and think since a famous person sings it, its okay to repeat it. I think if music with vulgar words was taking off the shelf at a library then kids would stop listening to it and there would not be as many problems. Racial slurs, cruel names, and foul language could all be stopped. All that has to be done is take out all books, movies, and music that has them in the readings, viewings, and lyrics. If this is done, I don't think there would be as many problems in future generations, because they wouldn't grow up reading about it, watching it, or even listening to it.",7830,7831.0,Racial slurs  cruel names  rude comments  things taken library  Young children allowed read things like  People US rude enough  younger children read  thinks alright say certain things read  Parents nt understand kids act way  opinion media  What watch see internet  even read  Many books good read  say crude things certain races  ll call certain race name  comments ethnicity  children read think s fine repeat certain people  Every one  books libraries say differently  They little kids read  one Movies kids watch foul language discrimination certain group people another reason think kids act bad days  They see people act movies  since movie think cool thing right thing  reality  s  When watch movie violence think okay go start fight  Or see something cool want try gets lot trouble  I think violent movies vulgar languages taken library shelf  kids would respect ethnicites stop rude people nt color religion  The music kids starting listen really vulgar  nasty words  Some music alright listen  music taken shelf  All younger kids go around quoting things rap song  parents still let listen  wonder happened child  They listen words start understand means  think since famous person sings  okay repeat  I think music vulgar words taking shelf library kids would stop listening would many problems  Racial slurs  cruel names  foul language could stopped  All done take books  movies  music readings  viewings  lyrics  If done  I nt think would many problems future generations  would nt grow reading  watching  even listening 
5405,2,"Censorship. That ugly word carries so much baggage. Many think it protects young minds, others feel that it infringes on their rights. Censoring books in libraries is in fact in violation of the rights espoused in the constitiution. I believe that people should be able to choose what they read, watch, or listen to. The government should not make that choice for us. The censorship of books, movies, and music has been happening for quite a while. Many classic books have been blacklisted because someone had the bright idea that these books permanently warp a child's innocent mind. While I believe there are certain books that should not be read by children, that does not mean that they should not be read by anyone. The library could indicate to parents that these books are for mature audiences and not for children by doing something as simple as placing a sticker on the book in question. Libraries could also just refuse to rent out a more mature book to children. I know from experience that some books should not be read by children because when I was younger, I checked out a book called the The in the I rented this book because I loved baseball and the word '@CAPS1' made me think it was about baseball. Not only was it extremely confusing, but also highly inappropriate for someone of my age. I have also seen children little more than eight years old renting movies from the library that contain explicit content. That being said, while these books and movies are not appropriate for children, mature adults should be free to read them. However, many books, movies, and songs have an extremely high volume of explicit content. Even these should not be removed from shelves, but they need clear warnings as to what sort of content is in them. People need to be free to choose what kind of content they are willing to expose themselves to, the government should not be able to choose for them. Censorship is a highly sensitive topic. Do we protect our children? Or do we pursue freedom? I say we do both.

When a person re-acts to something in a negative way maybe once in there life it happen to them in a postive outcome didnt come out. So if it gets brought back up they will take it offensive. Different outcomes can happen to anybody people take things different so if knowing something was offensive to people maybe it shouldnt be in the library because everybodys goes.

Lastly, what about the of People have different beliefs and opinions. These are what make us indivisuals. One person might think that a certain book is not appropriate for another.

5414,2,"Censorship of books and media in libraries is wrong. The idea of people taking things out of a library because they are offended by it is a violation of our rights as citizens of the People should be able to read whatever they want, and if someone does not like it, they can leave the library. There are many reasons why libraries should not be censored. This essay will highlight the top three reasons. The first reason that censoring libraries is wrong is because if someone sees something as offensive, it will have to be removed as Katherine Paterson says in her quote. That would cause problems. Reason number two is that censoring libraries would be a violation of rights. The third and final reason that censoring libraries is wrong is that it would do no good, people would still be able to get the material elsewhere. Censorship of libraries because of offensive material is wrong because of the reasons listed above. Censoring libraries because of offensive material would lead to the destruction of libraries! In the quote by Paterson she explains it well. In our day in age people can be offended by almost anything. Religious material and certain stories would be stripped from the shelves and it would be hard for people to read about them. People would be able to remove history books from libraries. It would lead to court battles and cost a lot of money. Everyone would be better off if libraries were not censored. Another reason not to censor libraries is that removing things from libraries is a violation of rights. The is based on freedom for the people. But censoring libraries would violate that freedom. People should have the right to read whatever they want, the libraries were created for them. Censoring libraries would make it harder for people to learn about their past. It is wrong to take media and books out of libraries because it is found offensive by a few people. The final reason to not censor libraries is that it would do no good. Banning books from a library would be like when the government tried to ban alcohol, it did not work. People would simply go somewhere else to get the material. It would only create a big hassle. From my own experience I have found that when something is banned, it just makes me want it all the more. Banning material in libraries would do nothing but create problems. Banning media and reading material from libraries because it is found offensive is wrong. As citizens we should have the right to read whatever we want in a library. The removal of material from shelves would literaly destroy our libraries. People would be allowed to remove whatever they wanted from the shelves. It is silly to think that banning something from a library would stop the use of it. It would just be a waste of time and effort. the result would be complaints and people going somewhere else to get the material.

5415,2,"Censorship in libraries seem ideal to some people, but personally it does not seem like a great idea. There are some kinds of media that all children should stay away from such as adult material and racial material, but it would not do justice to ban all inappropriate or offensive books and movies from a library. If books are not appropriate for children, then it would be best to educate the children to stay away from them. All books and other kinds of media should be available to the public. Most of the time when the type of media is offensive, it helps teach a lesson to the person observing it so that they understand the crudeness, such as slavery. Regardless of the topic that the book is about, it still teaches the reader, and banning some of these books restricts somebody from learning about those topics. Banning books and other kinds of media from a library is not needed and should not happen at all. Some people could argue and say that some of the adult material should be banned from public libraries so that thier children would not see it. There are some points to this arguement that most people would agree with, but however there is a counter-arguement. Even though some material should be for adults only, it should not be banned from public libraries. A better idea would to educate the children to stray away from the sections containing the adult or offensive material. Removing them entirely would not do justice to people who are of age to understand this material. Books and media should not be banned from public library just because they are offensive.

But in some part of the book told us about the descrimination to the black people and how the used them like enslaved and sometimes they sold the black people. In the book said the black people can not defend them self because they are enslaved. If the black people said something back to them, the white people kill the black person because it is offensive for the people.

In some places we have a lot people still enslaved and in my opinion I think its bad for the poor people. In some magazines told us about the violence between races or including for money. For example some rich people discrimined the poor people, and in my opinion it's bad because we have to help us each others. Some people are races too, because some people don't speak the same lenguage. I have a similar experience with this.

Taking books off of the shelves that seem offensive to someone else would in my mind hurt the literacy rate of today's The people that enjoy these types of books would no longer read because the one type of book that they are interested in was taken off of the shelves by someone else that thought that book was offensive. If you aren't interested in a book or find it 'offensive' then leave it on the shelf. If library's were taking books off of shelves that some people find offensive then you would be hurting the group of people that enjoys reading those types of literature. You would be taking the individuality away from those people. Here's an example, my aunt believes that is offensive and negative to her children. Should they remove that television show off of the air because simply one person feels that show is offensive. No, of course no that is just common sense. Leave the option of someone reading a certain book to the reader. In conclusion I feel as though the option of reading a certain book is up to the reader.

5429,2,"Libraries all over the world have books, movies, and magazines that are not approprite for all ages. Should these items be removed if they are found offensive? I agree that some books and magazines should be kept away from people that are not mature enough to view them. On the other hand, it is unfair to keep these from people who are mature and can use them properly. A 'reserved' shelf or section should be created only for the people thought fit to view these mature materials. The difference of perspective between a college student and a first grader is astounding. Where a college student would see a naked statue in a book as a work of art, the child would be exposed to things that should be censored from them until they are mature enough to view it. I would not want my five year old sister seeing a book with naked statues, but what if I needed that particular book? An assignment on early, art would be almost impossible to write beacuse of the lack of resourses. The reserved shelf or section would easily solve this problem in libraries. Librarians could collect all materials that are decided as 'offensive', and place these items onto the designed shelf. By doing so, the risk of these materials falling into the wrong hands is eliminated. The reserved shelf would keep resourses open to those who need it, but also give parents of young children peace of mind. Materials that would be placed on this 'reserved shelf' would need to be enquired about by atleast half of the users of the particular facility it was stored at. Things that would get these items on the shelf would be nudity, offensive language, racism, terrorism, ect.

5433,2,One thing i do now about censorship and it is that every one has to like it so if you see it well and you dont like it well all's I can do is who cares what you thank because im pretty gosh darn sure that some one eles out there in the world mind it and im saying they do like it its that they doen'@CAPS3 mind because its something thats apart of life. I can remeber a time when I got a book out about this old idian trib i had to do a writing esay. The only thing they whore was like some cloth around there wastes the girls or guys did have tops in the pictures well my partner had to take that book home for the night so he could do some work with it because I had it the night befor well I guesss when his mom got home she did like the pictures that was in the book. The next morning him and I both got called down the the office and the princable wanted to tell us that were going to have to find a different way to the trib becuase my parners mom called it in and did like it one bit. So they told us that were trying to do a little well the way I at it its that its a part of life and that it was for a progect and something like that matter its pictures its like its the real thing. So what im trying to get at is that its right for some of that becuase then how eles are we going to lern besides the internet because here at the are internet dont work all the time so sometimes if were doing a progect well then we got to get books. well if the books we need get pulled off the shelf well then i thank that we can get a bad grade because i dont know any teacher here let's you do a whole paper by getting things off the internet all the prgjecs i have done in my life had to have a book resorc. but like I said if they pull them off well then we got a problem and we fail that assiment because the people want to cencer something thats stupid.

5434,2,"Drugs and sex are found offensive, yes. But does that mean we need to take everything that has anything offensive off the shelves of librarys? My answer is no those books are for everyone, a lot of books and movies etc have that stuff in them, and its just normal this time in life. My first reason for choosing no is other people find that stuff interseting. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean someone else dosen't. What something means to you means something else to someone else. Maybe your husband likes cheaking out movies on people doing drugs but you don't are you going to just take that away, I wouldn't. This isn't just about one person its about everyone who checks things out from the library. Taking things out of the library just because they might be offensive? No one said they had to look at them. My reason for my decison for saying no is its normal to have that stuff around. Lots and lots of movies have offensive things in them, as do books and magazines. Its the normal now a days. People just expect it, so not too many people are going to find it offensive. I know i've seen people get mad in librarys because there was something offensive that they didn't want there child looking at well good for them but get them away from that if its such a problem. I don't belive that offensive things are necisarly bad, just because im used to that stuff i've grown up with it. You not have and have a different opinoin but I just think that stuff is normal. My third and final reason is a lot of books, magazines, and movies have that stuff in it. If you went through the library and took everything that had anything offensive in it there wouldn't be anything left. Then the library would just be full of boring books like how to cook a chicken, but people also think thats offensive too. Its just your outlook on the idea. Personally I think it would be a bad idea, its normal, other people like it and everything has offensive things in it.

5436,2,"First, I believe that some book, movies, and magazines should be removed or put in a older section of the libraries because some books have a lot of profinity in the book and negitive things in the book. Like for example my little sister bought home a book from the library and I saw her reading the book I know the book was bad because of the title so I ask her where she got the book from and she told me so I told my mother in she took the book back. The book had all types of things in it telling young people how to have sex when you're young and how fun it is to smoke and do drugs when you're young. Next, movies I believe that the library show just allow people who's old enough to rent the movie out. The library have all types of movies like all nasty movie that kids dont need to see. From one of my own experience I had a friend named and I always will go to house to play basketball so one day i went to house and told me that he had got a movie. Later on that day he ask me did I want to watch that movie in I said sure why not. Hours later we watching the movie and am see all things that my mother dont allow me to watch it got people getting killed, how to make drugs and all that stuuf. So when we got done watching the movie we went back out side to play basketball and told me that he wanted to sell drugs and kill people. Last, magazines shouls just be for old people because most magazines have adds in them persauding kids that they should smoke and that they should drink. Plus a magazine have all type of picture that not meant or kids to see and it makes some kids changes there mind about smoking. I know this person who read this magazine about smoking and he was smoking at the age of now he's smoking still smoking and he got cancer now from smoking. Conclusion, I believe that most library should put books, movies, and magazines that have profinity in it that have pictures that plus it will make kids thats really young change they mind about every thing.",7894,7895.0,First  I believe book  movies  magazines removed put older section libraries books lot profinity book negitive things book  Like example little sister bought home book library I saw reading book I know book bad title I ask got book told I told mother took book back  The book types things telling young people sex re young fun smoke drugs re young  Next  movies I believe library show allow people s old enough rent movie  The library types movies like nasty movie kids dont need see  From one experience I friend named I always go house play basketball one day went house told got movie  Later day ask I want watch movie I said sure  Hours later watching movie see things mother dont allow watch got people getting killed  make drugs stuuf  So got done watching movie went back side play basketball told wanted sell drugs kill people  Last  magazines shouls old people magazines adds persauding kids smoke drink  Plus magazine type picture meant kids see makes kids changes mind smoking  I know person read magazine smoking smoking age s smoking still smoking got cancer smoking  Conclusion  I believe library put books  movies  magazines profinity pictures plus make kids thats really young change mind every thing 
5437,2,"Libraries are a big part of peoples lives. Some love to read and go there to get there books. Books are meant to keep people occupied and to get someones attention. People go there to get their minds off things, like fighting or maybe avoiding that they can't read. When you walk in you expect quite, peace, and pasion for books. Everytime i go to the library i pick out a book that i am most intrested in and keep myself occupied. When i walk in i expect there to be no disruptions, like looking at magazines or books that just don't belong on the shelf. Why would any mother or father want their son watching or reading books that just do them any good. Libraries are for people that want to improve in their reading skills or maybe in their ability to read quicker. I've seen little kids come in and pick books up that they should have no business reading. In my opinion books are written to help you in anything that you need. Offensive music, magazines, books, etc., are jut pitiful! They just show how this world is becoming disastrive. While these kids or teenagers are looking at this, look at has happened to our kids. They don't listen to rules nore the disaplines you give them. Music has become a big part in our society. The rapping, country, and maybe even the hip-hop, but really has kids going? Rapping is a big issue! Now if music is being played and other people find it disterbing, then how is that appropriate. Offensive magazines is just not right! Kids know way to much at n age they should not. I'm sure no mother wants to see a looking at pornography, or maybe even sexual meanings in a magazine. Your learns more by looking at it's surroundings. Being in a library is a place where you respect other peoples space. Offensive books is where sexual meanings comes in. Now you see teenagers reading '@CAPS1 You also see them reading abusive books like '@CAPS3 kind of books are these for kids? Not the kind you want in your house! Libraries just don't need those books neither any other abusive, sexual, or books. The world would be a much nicer place and the library would be much more peaceful. As for my result i would want the nation world wide to remove books from the shelves if they are found offensive. You never know maybe more lives will live from not reading such meaningful books. So much more harm will decrease, as well as abuse. Now don't you think it will be better? I hope my recognition of removing offensive books can be noted",7896,7897.0,Libraries big part peoples lives  Some love read go get books  Books meant keep people occupied get someones attention  People go get minds things  like fighting maybe avoiding ca nt read  When walk expect quite  peace  pasion books  Everytime go library pick book intrested keep occupied  When walk expect disruptions  like looking magazines books nt belong shelf  Why would mother father want son watching reading books good  Libraries people want improve reading skills maybe ability read quicker  I ve seen little kids come pick books business reading  In opinion books written help anything need  Offensive music  magazines  books  etc  jut pitiful  They show world becoming disastrive  While kids teenagers looking  look happened kids  They nt listen rules nore disaplines give  Music become big part society  The rapping  country  maybe even hiphop  really kids going  Rapping big issue  Now music played people find disterbing  appropriate  Offensive magazines right  Kids know way much n age  I m sure mother wants see looking pornography  maybe even sexual meanings magazine  Your learns looking s surroundings  Being library place respect peoples space  Offensive books sexual meanings comes  Now see teenagers reading   CAPS You also see reading abusive books like   CAPS kind books kids  Not kind want house  Libraries nt need books neither abusive  sexual  books  The world would much nicer place library would much peaceful  As result would want nation world wide remove books shelves found offensive  You never know maybe lives live reading meaningful books  So much harm decrease  well abuse  Now nt think better  I hope recognition removing offensive books noted
5438,2,"Hello, my name is I am writing this letter to persuade you about the censorship in libraries. As i feel that there is age to consider when talking about childeren as well as the content of the books. I feel that the age of a child matters on the type of books they should read or even look at. A lot of kids in todays world watch movies with obscene language. I feel that it would be ok for a child over the age of fifthteen to read a book with minimal language. As long as the parent would allow the obscene language, then I would see that being ok. Now, as addition to this previous paragraph, I feel that any books with the bad language should be put away when littler kids are around. As little kids are more tedious to the language they hear and are more likely to repeat anything they hear or read. As I move on to the pictures in a book or a movie, I agree with the age limit set on movies. The age of seventeen is a good age without a parent present. I feel that anyone under the age of sixteen should not look at magazines or watch any movies with 'offensive' or 'disrespective' scenes or pictures. I see that this would protect the younger children from learning anything bad over the young years of their lives. Now as I move on to the music, you have to remember the new age and music that is running todays music scene. The most provokative music would probably be the rap and hip-hop music styles. The language as well as the image of the artists play a big part in how the kids act. I feel that we can't really control the music today's kids listen to. They have phones, music players, and radios. This allows a wide range of music to choose from. This is my essay and my final point on censorship: not only in libraries but in life, is up to the parents not just one person. Some kids are more mature than others and some less than others. This is my essay and i hope you enjoy it.",7898,7899.0,Hello  name I writing letter persuade censorship libraries  As feel age consider talking childeren well content books  I feel age child matters type books read even look  A lot kids todays world watch movies obscene language  I feel would ok child age fifthteen read book minimal language  As long parent would allow obscene language  I would see ok Now  addition previous paragraph  I feel books bad language put away littler kids around  As little kids tedious language hear likely repeat anything hear read  As I move pictures book movie  I agree age limit set movies  The age seventeen good age without parent present  I feel anyone age sixteen look magazines watch movies offensive  disrespective  scenes pictures  I see would protect younger children learning anything bad young years lives  Now I move music  remember new age music running todays music scene  The provokative music would probably rap hiphop music styles  The language well image artists play big part kids act  I feel ca nt really control music today s kids listen  They phones  music players  radios  This allows wide range music choose  This essay final point censorship  libraries life  parents one person  Some kids mature others less others  This essay hope enjoy 
5439,2,"I strongly believe that libraries should not have any books removed from their shelves for being offense. My main reason for this is that the view that something is offensive is simply an opinon and therefore it is wrong to remove the book based on the said opinon. If I thought a book should be removed just because it was bad would it happen? No! It wounld not. Why would it not you say? Beacause it is a opinon and there is no reason why it should be removed based on a opinon. First, i would like to state that just because someone is offended by something does not mean that book or word is offensive. What it does mean is that they as the person reading took the word or book offensive. For example, lets say that an elderly person is reading a book and in so said book it descibes a elderly character as an old coot. Now, this person find that desciption offensive to elderly people even though it was not directed to all elderly person but, instead it was just describing one. The elderly person might say that the word old coot is offensive to her and to elderly people everywhere. While another elderly person like the book and find the desciption of the 'old coot' correct. So therefore one person find it offensive and another not find it so even though they are both considered elderly. In conclusion that proves that how offensive something is is compleatly up to the person that is reading it and so is therefore an opinon and books should not be removed just because of an opinon.",7900,7901.0,I strongly believe libraries books removed shelves offense  My main reason view something offensive simply opinon therefore wrong remove book based said opinon  If I thought book removed bad would happen  No  It wounld  Why would say  Beacause opinon reason removed based opinon  First  would like state someone offended something mean book word offensive  What mean person reading took word book offensive  For example  lets say elderly person reading book said book descibes elderly character old coot  Now  person find desciption offensive elderly people even though directed elderly person  instead describing one  The elderly person might say word old coot offensive elderly people everywhere  While another elderly person like book find desciption old coot  correct  So therefore one person find offensive another find even though considered elderly  In conclusion proves offensive something compleatly person reading therefore opinon books removed opinon

5442,2,"Library censorship is one of those topics that can never be argeed upon. In a world full of different races, religions, and morals choosing what and what should not be on the shelves of libraries would be impossible because there would be nothing upon them. Removing such materials from selves to me would voilate someone's freedom of speech. With a world full of different thinkers trying to please everyone with what a person says, writes, or does, will not happen. In understand parents want to censor what their children see, watch, and read. But, in life a parent cannot protect their child forever from the world around them. For example, wrote the book in this book and a slave named travel down the river in hopes of becoming free from the bondage they faced at their homes in the Through out nigger is said multiple times when referring to In society they have decided to remove nigger from the book because they say the usuage of that word now is unproper. Despite being completely accurate for the published time period. Basically, making it a historical piece of literature. in this book demonstrating how black or white all are the same in life and slavery is wrong. At the library there a different sections a childrens, teen, adult, historical, etc. In the children section there are picture books with less words to appeal to the younger generation. In the teen section there are books that appeal to the adulences. Instead of parents wanting to take books, music, magazines, and movies off selves they need to simiply talk to their children about what is appropriate for them. I personally am I fan of rap music; old, new school it truly doesn't matter. Some parents would think that this music is foul and no one should make it, I will not say that their wrong for feeling this way but, I enjoy what I listen to. An explict rap artist I listen to is In his raps he says alot of cuss words, say nasty things about women and the struggles he faced as a child. is also one of the worlds' greatest poets when he was still living, he actually has a book out full of poems and has sold millions of copies. Another example is in the religion they think this book should be banned because of its witchcraft thinking that it's of the devil. is one of the top read books and most seen movies of the era removing said literature would upset the people who enjoy this genre of book. For the people that find it unproper they can not read it and not see the movies. With everyone being of diffent morals and backgrounds remvoing literature from the sleves would be wrong. There can be no way to please everyone with what's on the selves. In a world of individuals with different morals people's censorship is diffent levels are different also. In life no one can simply remove items from sleves because they feels it's offensive. If that happened there would be no civil rights or political parties. A solution instead of removing books, magazines, and movies, etc. is that parents need to talk to their children about what is appropriate for them as individuals and what is not. Katherine Paterson's quote is correct everyone has a right to remove material they find offensive but, by doing this action there would be no libraries or books. Removing historical books would because someone finds them offensive would leave us as individuals in society with no knowledge of the past and no hope for the future because everyone would lack knowing where they came from causing history to repeat itself. For example,I am an and in society if knowledge of slavery were to be removed from the selves who's to say that slavery would not reoccur later in life when my generation is pasted and openmindedness is gone because of lack of knowledge",7906,7907.0,Library censorship one topics never argeed upon  In world full different races  religions  morals choosing shelves libraries would impossible would nothing upon  Removing materials selves would voilate someone s freedom speech  With world full different thinkers trying please everyone person says  writes   happen  In understand parents want censor children see  watch  read  But  life parent protect child forever world around  For example  wrote book book slave named travel river hopes becoming free bondage faced homes Through nigger said multiple times referring In society decided remove nigger book say usuage word unproper  Despite completely accurate published time period  Basically  making historical piece literature  book demonstrating black white life slavery wrong  At library different sections childrens  teen  adult  historical  etc  In children section picture books less words appeal younger generation  In teen section books appeal adulences  Instead parents wanting take books  music  magazines  movies selves need simiply talk children appropriate  I personally I fan rap music  old  new school truly nt matter  Some parents would think music foul one make  I say wrong feeling way  I enjoy I listen  An explict rap artist I listen In raps says alot cuss words  say nasty things women struggles faced child  also one worlds  greatest poets still living  actually book full poems sold millions copies  Another example religion think book banned witchcraft thinking s devil  one top read books seen movies era removing said literature would upset people enjoy genre book  For people find unproper read see movies  With everyone diffent morals backgrounds remvoing literature sleves would wrong  There way please everyone s selves  In world individuals different morals people s censorship diffent levels different also  In life one simply remove items sleves feels s offensive  If happened would civil rights political parties  A solution instead removing books  magazines  movies  etc  parents need talk children appropriate individuals  Katherine Paterson s quote correct everyone right remove material find offensive  action would libraries books  Removing historical books would someone finds offensive would leave us individuals society knowledge past hope future everyone would lack knowing came causing history repeat  For example  I society knowledge slavery removed selves s say slavery would reoccur later life generation pasted openmindedness gone lack knowledge
5443,2,"I think that it is dumb to remove all of the books that some people find offensive, because what if other people find it interesting? If they move all of those books, what will they find that will be suitable for them? I think that the people who find stuff offensive should just leave it alone and go about their own business. How would you like it if you spent all your hard earned work on a book just for someone to get mad and take it away? It do not make any sense and it is not right. First, say someone on a daily basis comes to check out a certain type of book that they find interesting, and one day they come there and it is banned or something. What if that person was you? You would be pretty mad right? I know I will. So what if you find a topic offensive, it wasn't exactly aimed at you now was it? Probably not, so you should just not worry about it. Second, if you see a book on a shelf that offends you, I think the best thing for you to do is just ignore it and go on in your life. There are going to be thousands of things on earth that can offend you, but you can not take them all out. I mean you can try but will you be sucessful at it? You can be sucessful at a few but there will always be more that comes up, so why try. Last, why would you try to take away some elses hard earned work? Put your self in their position, you will be mad if you come to find out that your book/music/movie or something else has be canceled because somebody did not like it.Thats messed up right? What about the hundreds or even thousands or more of people that liked it finds out that its gone because of you, and worse they even know that you had something to with it. Now you have alot of people hating you because of your opinion. I'm not saying to keep your opinion to yourself , but with situations like this it's best to. In conclusion, I think that it is not a good idea to do such a thing. Just think of all the worse outcomes that you can bring opon your self, like having a lot of people against you because you took something away from them that they liked, or taking away a aurthors dream.

5444,2,"Should a book be removed from the shelf of a library? Should the book be left there for all to read? What if this book is offensive. If you remove a book that is offensive to one person, doesn't that mean I have to remove a book that is offensive to other people too? Soon after we remove stuff that is offensive to certain peoples, we then run out of books at the library. I think we have the right to read, watch, and listen to whatever we want. I'm sure if everyone tried hard enough to look for it, I'm sure they would find a book, movie, magazine, or audiotape that they found offensive. They would then request that the book would be removed from the library shelves. Then if everybody did that, there would be no more books on the library shelves. Everybody is going to be offended by something. Like the quote from the author Katherine Paterson 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' is saying that if we all have the right to remove a book from the library shelves then we will have no more books left for the library shelves. If you have a book you want to be removed for your childs sake, ask if it be moved someplace else where the child can't get to it, like an adult section. I went to a library about two years ago. While I was the there was a person trying to get the librarian to take a book off of the shelves. said no. Why? 'We know you don't like this book. You are trying to get it removed. Then when a person comes walking in looking for that book or a book like it, then they don't have something to read. If I let you remove this book, then I would have to let everybody else remove a book. Thats not fair to the library or anyone else, is it.' With that he left the library in defeat.

The libraies should have a section on everything not just stuff they think is appropriate for some people they should have whats good for everyone.

The reason I say this is because people spend to much time trying to keep stuff out of their libraries, that they dont think about the learning experience. If they allowed all kinds and makes of media they could just put sections on ages. When you dictate whats in the libraies some of the stuff people need are in books, videos, music, and, etc. Stuff that cant be found other places. So if they included everything in libraries some people could find stuff they were looking for that they couldnt find if they didnt have internet at there household. in my experience some stuff is found better in book than on the internet because the were there before the internet. Most stuff on the internet was added to it from a book or just the thoughts of another person. If you put more of everything in your libraies kids would learn how to read better, learn quicker, and exercise if they can walk to a public library. I think libraies should put how to make stuff anything everything in libraies so kids and adults would get interested.

But it all goes back to what I mentioned earlier that there should be ushers that direct people(children) to there sections and there won't be any problems or any offended parents.

5447,2,"Censorship in libraries is something that should be taken rather seriously. I beleive that children should have the freedom to read whatever book they pick off of the shelf. We should not put limits on our children's books that they are allowed to read. Growing up as a child, there was no one to tell me what books I could and could not read. Children are not oblivious to the world, and sooner or later they are going to figure stuff out. I think that maybe we could put a censorship on movies and magazines that you can get, but not books. When I was little, one of the ways I learned what I know now was from reading. I used to read books on vacations and if I came upon a word I didn't know I would ask my mom and it expanded my vocabulary. By limiting the children to what books they can read, you are also limiting them to what they can learn on their own. I do agree that not all books are appropriate for little kids to be reading. I also think that the kids of today know more than what I knew at that age. They definately know more than what most adults think they know. Sooner or later the time is going to come that they will figure out all of this inappropriate stuff anyways, so why not just let them expand their horizons on their own? I think that movies and magazines should be more of the concern than books. For a censorship to be put on those two would be more reasonable. A book is limited to the child's imagination, but movies and magazines sometimes have nasty pictures, or will actually show things that should not be seen by the eye of a five year old. As you know, the children of today are going to be the leaders of tomorrow. If we continue to shelter our kids too much, they are going to be lost when they become adults. By limiting children on what movies and magazines they can get from a library is just enough to protect their eyes from what is necessary.

5449,2,"Removing Offensive From Libraries Or There are books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials that are available to people and some are offensive to certain people. Sould they be taken off of shelves? My opinion is that they should be taken off. Some can be very offensive to people and hurt them terribly. Some of them sometimes go to far and can offend some people. To begin with, there are materials that have lots of swear words and bad language. This can be offensive to people if they have differnet beliefs or religions, or if they don't like hearing or reading it constantly. For instance if there was a book that had swear words on every page and someone got really offended by it then I believe it sould be removed. Music on the other hand can also go to far, and music is everywhere; people have their own likings and tastes for certain music. It make complete sense to take all offensive music off the shelf, but it sould be done. The music is going away entirely, just in certain places. Another point that I will make is that some materials like books and magazines will have things in them about types of people and say terrible things that can be offensive or can be taken that way. There are people with diseases, conditions, and other things that are made fun of in materials like music. This can be very offensive to people especially if it affects them directly. If you had a condition you could control, help, or fix, would you want someone writing or making fun of it and other people that have it? I certainly know that I wouldn't. Things written and published that are rude, make fun of people, and hurt them, is nice and can make people feel terrible on top of it. I personally believe that like that should be removed from shelves. The last reason for why offensive materials should be taken off the shelf is that it is kind. People should care about other people's feelings. We are all human and everyone has something that they find hurtful and offensive. If someone asks to have a taken off the shelf in a library, people should be considerate and take it off. People need to start caring more about other people's feelings no matter what it is about. For these reasons and more I believe that specific materials should be taken off of shelves if they are found offensive. It's like the is being completely destroyed; they are still in stores and can be bought anywhere. If someone really wants to read something that someone else found offended, then it should be a problem for them to go out and buy it or find it somewhere else. These materials are found everywhere and are available to many people.

For school projects or activities, the teachers have specific rules for what the students choose to read and music they listen to.

If there was a debate on taking offensive books,music, and movies off of the shelf i feel that they would end up staying.

The library taking things off the shelf is not right people shoulf have the right to watch or read what they want. So in my own personal opinion libraries need to stop taking things off the shelves. People have their own opinion also on things if they feel something is to offensive don't use them. People that try to get offensive things taken off of the shelves are trying to protect others from seeing certain things. Movies for instance have a rating on them you have to be a certain age to buy some movies. If a parent feels like their child shouldn't watch those movies dont buy them for their children. Others have an opposite opinion on things. Some people feel like those things are a part of life maybe and them and their kids should know about them. Seeing certain offensive things could make some realize to not do things like that. Where people who dont see those things are maybe one day do some things that happen in those stories or movies.

5454,2,"Censorship has been around for about as long as novels, plays, music, movies, magazines, any form of media really, has been around. My question is, what is the big deal? In our constitution it is said that we have freedom of speach. How can we have freedom of speach if we can't write what we want in books and magazines, and if we can't say what we want on television or on the radio? I believe that censorship in libraries, or anywhere else, is unnecessary. In most of the libraries I've been to, there is a children's section and an adult section. While the material in the children's section should definitely be the material in the adult section should be left uncensored. Most adults can handle slightly explicit words or actions appearing in a book or in the music they listen to. If one person or another opposes the 'explicit' version of a book, or magazine, they should simply avoid reading that specific book/magazine or listening to the music on that specific Its simple, really, if you don't like it, avoid it. Why should one book be taken off the shelves because its 'offensive' to one person or a group of people? The way an author writes is their choice, and they should be able to have the right of freedom of expression. Readers should also be able to have the right to enjoy the books they like, without any censorship added to it. In conclusion, I believe censorship is wrong, and should not be allowed in libraries.

5456,2,"Keeping I know the whole point of a library is to find facts and knowledge about certain things. I beleive that there shouldn't be any censorship in libraries. I beleive this because if something is offensive then find out why it's become so offensive. Another reason would be the offensive meterial is still apart of history and no one has the right to take that away. Lastley I think that everyone has a right to veiw what they want. If someone finds something offensive in a library I don't think they should just throw it out. Though it be offensive you can still read it to better your judgment on the topic such as racism, slavery, or other touchy matters. If you take that off the shelf its just less knowledge people will have about the world and people will be less about certain subjects. People like to find out new things, weather it be offensive or not. If you took that away then people will be that much more blind about the past, and we will not learn from anything. History is a huge part of the world its what defines everything and how we move forward into the future. Certain people like certain things and everyone has a right to view what they please. Some people have different beleifs, religous views, and opinions and if someone finds that offensive then too bad because as I said before everyone is going to have a different out look on something. You dont have to like everything but people are going to beleive in what they beleive and there is such a thing as tolorence.

People don't want to read those types of books, it gets people, like me, mad. A book that is offensive is definitely wrong in many ways, it can hurt people's feelings, the people that are offended by the book can't stick up for their own thoughts, and it just down right wrong. Reading a book that is offensive can hurt not only the person it is offending, but also friends, family, and others. When children and adults read stories, they want to be happy afterwards and the author wants them to read it again. But if the author is offensive in maybe only one way, they never get that second scan of the book. What if someone wrote a book that offends you? How would you feel? Books that have already been written and found offensive; no one can stick up for themselves, because the book has already been sold around the world. That's what's wrong with this world, no one sticks up for not only themselves, but for other people. In this case, no one can make a stand.What if someone wrote a book that offends you? How would you feel? There are some arguments out there about this debate. Yes, it is the author's opinion, but does that make it right? Yes, some people like the offensive books because it doesn't offend them. Some people have to realize that most books are made to inform you, not offend.

How do you think people learn about whats going on out here in the world now? Some people just dont care if they do or dont take them out of libraries, because they dont come to the libraries to read or to come and get movies and books things.

5460,2,"'Books are the light of the world'(unknown). I believe that books are a important part of our society. Without books we would have even more poor readers than we already have. In the world we live in today you need to know how to read. If you dont know how to read in this day you are prone to fail in these times. In my opinion no book should be taken off of the shelf for any reason. America needs all the books we can get. Books are not just sheets of paper with words on them, they are a universe. If someone were to take books away with certain things that were found offensive, then there would be no books left. Someone could find something offensive in any book. Everyone in the world is different, therefore diffrent people find diffrent things to be offensive. And if we take a book or magazine away for everybody in the world their would be no more books. Music on the other hand, is a little bit more complicated. We have a lot of rappers in this generation. Some good, some not so much. All of the nonsince that the rappers talk about today is corrupting our young minds. Lets take for example. he talks about something that could bring you up one minute, and then the next he is degrading woman. Should rappers like this albums be sold to the public? Ok let me elaborate. It my be ok for adults but then a child come long and hear it and then we have a problem. I believe that music not have to be took of of the market but it should have an age restriction. Everybody likes some movies, but some are not appropreate for young children. Now every time you look at a movie or television you see sex, drugs, or you hear bad language. And this happens on national television! Little kids go to the movies to see a movie and they see some type of sexual interface. That is not heathy for a young developing mind. i think in this situation also, the parents should be more careful of what they let thier children view. In conclusion we need books, we like music, and we enjoy movies. Some good and some bad out of every category, it is up to the person to view or to reject content. And we should be aware of what is out there that can harm the children too.

Just dust and a bunch of lonly book shelf's. In fact not even the music, movies or magazines would be there, because someone have a dislike about them too.

5462,2,"Censored or uncensored? I think that there are various reasons for both of the choices in many peoples opinions. Mostly everyone would have different reasons for why the libraries should be censoring what we look at, read, and listen too. I am going to give my personal opinion in this paper about why we might need to be censored and why we should'nt. I believe that mainly everyone should have their own choice to be able to see, listen, and look at whatever they want. I think that libraries should censor some websites from younger kids such as porn websites. Other people might think that we should'nt be able to listen to music talking about sex, drugs, and alcohol but, I feel we should have that right to listen to the type of music thats out there. Listening to the music does not make us do or say what is in the song lyrics but simply could make someone chose a career in the music industry. I have a neighbor that is very religious and her mom does not allow her and her sisters to really choose anything for themselves. I went to their house one day and I had my ipod with me listening to rap and hip hop and my friend had never heard of it and i was shocked to learn her parents only ;et her listen to mainly christian music, and her mom blocks many of her television shows so she is not exposed to things her mom believes as of sins. I think that it is her moms right to censor what only she listens to and sees. Her daughter should be abe to make her own choices in life and decide for herself who she is and what she listens to. Because her mom will not always be there to censor her life and protect her from everything that could possibly offend her once she is out and on her own. I very strongly feel that libraries should not censor the things we choose to look at, listen to, and read.

The materials are for all eyes to see, some people are not intended to see but it happens. It just dosent seem fair that one person can go and read/listen/watch something but the other one can't. If something is in the it is meant for all eyes not for just certain people. The materials tyhat the has should be kept out of reach for the people that are not supposed to be seeing them, and it is not the libraries fault if the item is offensive to people.

She was only fourteen when she was shot to death. There is one in five people that has listen to the violent music. There are some many kids that have been exposed to drugs from their parents. I am here to tell you that we need to take the violent materials off the shelves because it makes human beings think it is right to kill someone and doing illegal drugs. The materials can put us at harm and could make the teenagers go out of control. The singers that sing about using drugs and killing people make the kids think it is right for them to do. The kids will take guns from their parent`s room or will get in to a gang. The gangs will do drive by shotings on the streets and could kill as many as ten people. The violent books and violent music needs to get off the shelfs before everyone gets killed. The violent music is not allowed at school. The teachers and school board have banded the violent music from being played in schools. When a child listens to it at home then it could harm the students at school if they try to being it to school. The people will hear on or in a movie about illegal drugs. They can read about the illegal drugs that are used in books and magazines. The movies allow the actors to smoke and do drugs on screen. The kids will think if the actors can do it then we as kids can do it.The movies that have drugs or violents in them should be removed from the shelfs. The children think they can get away with muder or getting high. The school`s choice is to have a lock down about every two months to search students bags. They will have a cop come in with a dog to snift their bags for drugs or anything that is not allowed. A police officers can arrest anyone that brings or does illegal drugs on pubic porverty or if someone tells that they see them doing it. Some children`s parents do not care if they do drugs as long as they do not get caught. The students will come to school the next day after getting high, which messes up their grades. The parents need get arrested if they allow a minor to do illegal drugs. The children that do drugs and are minors should be sentence as an adult.

5465,2,"Why is there so much censorship in the world? What are we trying to hide? It's almost as if we are lying to our selfs by hiding all the explicit material in the world. Who gets the right to say wether or not something should be taken off the shelves at libraries? Sure, not all material is appropriate for certain age levels, but where is that line of appropriate, and nonappropriate? It is plain and simple, people of certain ages should have material that is suitable for their age. However just because a book, magazine, or movie isn't suitable for them doesn't mean it should be banned. If I were an author and I spent hours, days, months, even years on a book and finally I release it to the public, come to find out a few weeks later it has been banned, I would be furious! The sad thing is that this happens all the time to authors. I feel like that if all material was banned because it wasn't suitable for certain people, there wouldn't be anything left. My nephew is three years old and what he watches on tv is not what I watch on tv. How many sixteen year olds do you know that still watches Thats right none! How many three year olds do you know that watch what sixteen year olds watch? Once again none! What I'm saying is that certain ages like to watch or read certain things. There fore banning material is pointless because what ever is being banned be what someone else enjoys. There is nothing out there in the world that should be banned. People should have the right to learn and educate themselves, why would somebody take that away from them? To solve this problem libraries should have sections suitable for certain ages. Have a section suitable for kids three to six, seven to ten, eleven to fourteen, fifteen to seventeen, and finally eighteen on up. This way a child that is nine won't accidentally pick up a book that is meant for somebody fourteen or older. I have to agree that censoring is good if it is keeping younger people from reading or seeing something they shouldn't.

5468,2,"I don't really have too big of a view on cencorship when it comes to things people can get at a library. I don't think that there should be age limitations on what some people cannot get, for instance how you usually have to be or older to get an rated movie. I don't see why you shouldn't be able to do something like that just because of your age. Some people can deal with what they see in movies like that and others if they got something like that and didn't like it or found it to be inappropriate they will have learned from their mistake (although some people would rather just not go through that process). I agree with it at the same time though since most year olds probably shouldn't be getting something like that anyways in the first place. I also agree with Katherine's opinion to some extent, if people could just take off the shelves what they dont like/find inappropraite then a large majority would probably be removed and the people that actually like what was removed would be out of luck. Just like with most things I think it should depend on the situation to decide what should be done, for instance letting someone get a movie or book that is viewed as inappropriate for those under a certain age get what they want there if they're used to watching/reading things like that. When it comes to music I can't really see any need for restriction unless there's offensive sentences being said in it or if the meaning of the song is inappropriate. I don't see what need there is for magazine restrictions on anything except considerably inappropriate or offensive ones. Books can definitely need some restrictions based on content or if it's bad enough it should probably be removed from normal libraries just like some movies.

So if a child would go to another section instead of the section that is appropraite for them and get an offensive or inapropraite book for their age it would be their fault for going to a different section and getting it.

With all of the magazines that talk about how girls should look and some with violence, it sets a bad example for the children. The worst part about it is how easy it is for a child to get a magazine or book. This is why the library should sensor what they put on the shelves.

The first section should be zero to twelve years old should be zero to six years old becauce during this time you should be read books that are very simple and teach you simple things.

They seem to know more bad word than I do know that I am older. They also seem to talk about drugs a lot more. When I was this young i did not even know drugs were, I never herd of them. The last thing that books, movies, magazines about violence and drugs does is it makes them violent. they see on the videos they do in real life and that is not good for there development. The second age group is thirteen years old to seventeen years old. At this point in there lives books, movies, music, etc. should be more adult like. These books, movies, music etc. should be about some adult things. They sill should not be about sex and naket people.They Should be about the thing drugs do to you and they look like but not how to use them. The books should deel with teen and adult thinngs though. It is good for them to learn about things that happen to teens and adults so they can learn from there mastakes. The last section of the library should be four people over eighteen only. These books,movies, magazines should be about ever. Once you turn eighteen you are a leagle adult.When you are an adult you should be able to see or watch ever you want. You should be able to play ever movie you want no matter how violent or nasty.

5473,2,"Censorship in libraries is a very important, but confusing topic to many people. The problem is that a greatly respected, renown author might write a novel that is a little bit too offending, and a discision would have to be made whether to keep that book on the shelf or not. Either way people are going to be offended, whether that is taking the book off the shelf and offending the author, or a gradeschool student curiously picks up the book and is appauled with what he/she finds. It is somewhat of a lose-lose for the library and surrounding staff. If the author has other great books and is well respected then he has the right to be able to have his book on the shelf, even if it is a little bit edgy. The author obviously means well, he is not trying to offend anybody or anything of the sort. But, without people reading his work he is not going to make any money. That in itself is offending. I have read some offending and even insulting novels myself, and honestly, I think it is good for you to read liturature that is out of the ordinary. It opens your eyes to other things that are not included in your little world. Somewhat of a new outlook on the topic. The decision is not up to me, but if it was I would try and keep all the books on the shelves. If books are offending people in then the people of this country need to grow up.

Personally for me, I don't go to the library as often as others but, I do know that some things on the shelves are not always appropriate for younger less intelligent eyes to look at or read. I don't believe they should be taken out of the library completely but, I do belive there should be a specific area these certain books and other material should be placed. In that I mean they should have their own specific area like a back room or a nook in the library where only specific aged people can go. The age should be posted in the area and someone should be there at all times to monitor who comes in and goes out. You must have proof of age and accessability. The librarian must pass out cards to people who are old enough to go back there. Like I said, I don't go to public libraries like most but, I do know of inappropriate materials are there and not properly monitored.These are my personal opinions and hopefully they don't offend anyone as much as the offensive contents in our public libraries today.",7970,7971.0,This review shows personal views wether offensive  books  music  movies  magazines shelf local library  Personally  I nt go library often others  I know things shelves always appropriate younger less intelligent eyes look read  I nt believe taken library completely  I belive specific area certain books material placed  In I mean specific area like back room nook library specific aged people go  The age posted area someone times monitor comes goes  You must proof age accessability  The librarian must pass cards people old enough go back  Like I said  I nt go public libraries like  I know inappropriate materials properly monitoredThese personal opinions hopefully nt offend anyone much offensive contents public libraries today 
5475,2,"I'm writing on if books, music, movies and other things that are found offensive should or should not be removed from public libraries. Well I would have to disagree because if a book is offensive well then there are many books to read in the public library but there would to have something be done. They might have these books in a sepreate section of the library but that also goes for offensive music, movies and recordings. The point is that there should always be a other book to read if there isn't one you like to read but there are some books that should be taken off the shelf in the public library. But, if they do take the book of the shelf they will keep that book away from the public readers. Also, there are many other ways to deal with books that offend the people but if the book should be to offensive and too crude then we should immediately take that book right off the shelf for no one to see and possibly have a person in higher power to take it off the marketplace also. But, the importance of this is to keep the youth and the young away from many bad things so they will grow up to be intellegent and read actual knowledge and learn and for them not to read suck pittyful writting. We should try to not let kids read bad things so they won't learn to do bad things and speak bad things. Also, to protect many people from maybe racial judgement in books about racism about a certain ethicity group. We the people just don't want any horrible books to be out there for kids, teens and many other people to read and start to become and bad person after reading that. But, it all depends on the type of book its turned out be. Never judge a book by it's cover, judge it by it's content.

5476,2,"Content of Our Libraries are a lot of books that are not appropiate for young children. Like wise, if we had libraries directed to one single age group of people, libraries would be virtually usless to most of the population. It is the parent's job to control what their children are reading, not the library's. Parents should inform their children, limate them, and moniter what they do in the library. The library is a great place for parents to bring their children for some easy entertainmant. While are many good books for them. are also many advanced and inappropraite books too. The library serves all age groups, so on the shelf is material that can relate to all age groups. Parents should talk to their kids about what they can and can'nt look at or listen to. If caught with somthing they should'nt have, they should be punished. The library can'nt have books olny directed for young children, it's not their job to watch what other peoples kids pick up. It's the parents recponcibility. All the books in the library are not scattered around, they are organized by age group and genre. specific places for children are desinated. If parents have young children and are worried about what they look at, they should limate them to a particular section. Tell your child that they are to get books from this section olny and will be punished if they disobay. Telling them this will give you more control over what that child is looking at. If they are in the children's section and find a book on sex or somthing related that is inapropriate for young children, then the library can be to blame. Limating your child to a specific genre, will prevent them from getting into offensive and age inapropriate content. When cheaking out library books parents should remain with their children, to insure that they have'nt chosen anything they should'nt be looking at. When they bring you their basket of books, dont assume they have approoriate books. Go threw them and cheak. If a child is allowed to cheakout on their own without parental supervision, that parent should'nt be suprised when their child brings an inapropriate book home. The library is not responciable for what someone's child picks up and cheaks out. Parents should monitre their kids when at the library before and after they have selected books. The library can be a fun and informitive place for children and their parents. Parents need to remember that the library is a place for all age groups, so all diffrenmt types of content will be presant.

5477,2,"Asking if censorship should be permitted in libraries is like asking if it's okay to take away the basic human right of choice. What one person consider to be extremely inappropriate be seen as totally acceptable to another. By censoring the books, magazines, movies, and music that are put on the shelves at public libraries, there would be many important works of literature and art lost because someone deemed the content to be unacceptable. But for what reason do they find it unacceptable? Most would say that young children especially shouldn't be put in harms way of revolting musical, theatrical, and literary items. Which, that staement is very true! However, what is considered to be 'revolting' to one set of parents not even be a logical reason to consider it that way to another. For example, some parents believe that any kind of book or movie with magic in it is a way of destructing a child's mind and would label it unworthy of resting on a library's bookshelf because of their religious backgrounds. This means that a book that have numerous moral lessons and show qualities of friendship and courage could be classified as inappropriate just because of a bit of fun magic. What about people, though, who are at an accountable age that can make their own choices? They are the ones causing the refute over the issue of censorship. The controversy over censorship can not be resolved, however, because the ideas of what should and should not be allowed on the shelves at libraries differ greatly. A person's perspective on such things is weighed by their religious backgrounds, parental upbringings, and personal morals and convictions. Since everyone is different in those ways, not everyone would have the same decision over whether or not a certain kind of media is okay to display. There are some books, movies and music, admittingly, that are so vial and disgusting that no one should ever lay their eyes on them or permit their ears to absorb such things. It is imparative that society keeps itself from being overcome with wicked videos with inappropriate scenes, music with terrible language, or books describing things that should be left unsaid. With that said, society can and will never come to a standing agreement as to what is and is not acceptable. Therefore, who has the right to remove these things from the library when no one person has the same conviction as another? In conclusion, if censorship begins now, how much longer until the only thing covering the libraries' bookshelves is dust?No one person should be allowed to completely determine the appropriateness of the items found in a public library. It is up to each individual person to decide what is personally in the best interest of themselves, not what they think everyone else should abide by.",7976,7977.0,Asking censorship permitted libraries like asking s okay take away basic human right choice  What one person consider extremely inappropriate seen totally acceptable another  By censoring books  magazines  movies  music put shelves public libraries  would many important works literature art lost someone deemed content unacceptable  But reason find unacceptable  Most would say young children especially nt put harms way revolting musical  theatrical  literary items  Which  staement true  However  considered revolting  one set parents even logical reason consider way another  For example  parents believe kind book movie magic way destructing child s mind would label unworthy resting library s bookshelf religious backgrounds  This means book numerous moral lessons show qualities friendship courage could classified inappropriate bit fun magic  What people  though  accountable age make choices  They ones causing refute issue censorship  The controversy censorship resolved  however  ideas allowed shelves libraries differ greatly  A person s perspective things weighed religious backgrounds  parental upbringings  personal morals convictions  Since everyone different ways  everyone would decision whether certain kind media okay display  There books  movies music  admittingly  vial disgusting one ever lay eyes permit ears absorb things  It imparative society keeps overcome wicked videos inappropriate scenes  music terrible language  books describing things left unsaid  With said  society never come standing agreement acceptable  Therefore  right remove things library one person conviction another  In conclusion  censorship begins  much longer thing covering libraries  bookshelves dust  No one person allowed completely determine appropriateness items found public library  It individual person decide personally best interest  think everyone else abide

5479,2,"I believe that censorship in libraries should not be allowed. No one should have the right to prohibit someone else from watching, reading, or listening something they might think is offensive. People have different views and opinions.

If you do not want to read, watch, or listen to something, you don't have to. It's a free country and no one is making you do things. Everyone has the freedom to do what they please, whether it is right or wrong. If you do something you aren't supposed to do, there are consequences. In the case of reading, watching, or listening, no one is actually doing these actions, therefore not causing any harm. If parents and other adult leaders find something offensive, they should discuss it with children, so they understand people's points of view. If adults are worried about exposing children to sex, violence, and foul language, they need to realize these things actually happen in real life. You can't pretend that they don't, even if you don't agree with it. Children need to learn about human nature, so they know what is right and wrong when they are facing a difficult situation.

5481,2,"To whom it concern I am doing some research and finding some interresting facts about books, magazines, and other sources that our young youth get their hands on today. I am very active in our community and I do find it quite offensive in various ways that certain materials are in libraries, and in easy reach of our youth. In our everyday life now we hear the younger youth from starting age of probably ten years old using language that would give our grandmothers a heart attack. Then we complain as a community why we aren't 'shining' like certain communities are. Why is this you ask. Well, if you let me share with you I will tell you some key points and reasons to why I think some materials should be removed from libraries or just placed in out of reach areas from our youth. In this day and age all kids and teenagers have to do is turn on the t.v and listen to all the offensive language, gestures, or just information from today's society. Quite sad in my opinion, and so why in the world we want to make matters worse by putting books about guns, sex, succide, drugs, or just things that will provoke the younger age to having such negitive thoughts. So they say that now a days that teenagers are much more stressed, tired, and depressed about things in life. If you ask me it's probably by all the garbage that their parents let them get ahold of. It kills me listening to kids coming from kindergarden saying cuss words, and believe they do! As long as we keep the violent and aggressive stuff out of reach of the kids I would be perfectly fine with that. I will take what I get at this moment. If we cared more about the younger youth and putting them first then ourselves sometimes we would probably find ourselves living happier lifes. So you see not everybody wants to live a life that is depressing, fulled with doubt and depression, and just plain saddeness. We will probably find ourselves in a world of hurt if we keep letting the younger ones get their hands on music that is teaching them how to smoke, use drugs, and mistreat their wives. Once you listen to certain lyrics over and over again, start memorizing the song, and then you start living the song sometimes. Lets not waste time and let our younger society get worse,and go downhill.

5482,2,"Do you think reading materials should be removed from our school and public libraries because they can be seen as offensive? I don't! I think all reading materials should be allowed in all libraries. I think that censorship on what students and people find in school and public libraries should be banned. I feel that when the government censors out materials about whats going on in the world, they are taking away materials people could use to educate themselves further in the crisises our world is facing. How does the governmant expect students to relate to what is happening in the world, if they are censoring out things that would help them understand better. When I was in middle school I would always read magaizines to find out what peopl in other countries were facing in their daily lives. Then one day when I was looking for a current issue of one I wasn't able to find one. So then when I asked my school librarian why there was no more magazines she said that the school felt some of the material was to graphic for children our age.You not see how that has affected me, but if it weren't for that I would have a better understanding of why are world is turning out the way it is instead of tryign to understand it all at once. I also feel that when public libraries have to censor what materials they put out that is taking away from our rights. Yes, I agree that libraries should not have out articles or any extremely graphic materails out where young adolescents can see it, but I still feel that they should be able to have their own section somewhere else in the facility where they watch who go into that section and out so adults who want to view that material can.

5483,2,"How are people affected by censorship? People are affected by censorship because they no longer have the ability to learn about all that they can. Libraries are supposed to be a source of knowledge in my opinion, but when published books are taken off the shelves, this cannot be accomplished well. Censorship is a roadblock when trying to do what takes place everyday, learning. I can see why people would want information to be censored from their children. The reason would be because they don't want their children knowing of all the negative happenings in the world, but as I have said, everyone should have the right to learn as much as they desire. Censorship hasn't been too much of an issue here in the Much to my chagrin, there has been some conflict when officials wanted to remove the popular children's book written by the wonderful from libraries. The reason people wanted this book gone was because of the slang used in the book. The slang could be perceived as hurtful, but I believe that the slang contributes to the book and the time in which it was written. I recently read a book that I found very well written, but the book was on a sensitive topic: The The book is entitled and it is written by survived The and wrote this book as a memoir. I personally would enjoy knowing that my kids and even their kids read this book so that the world never forgets this treacherous occurance, but because the book is about a sensitive topic, it could be censored in some places.

5484,2,"My opinion is that in libraries, there should be certain sections that are set apart from the rest of the library in order to protect the children from explicit books, magazines, and movies. This is mainly because developing children are curious. They are naturally curious because from a young age, all children want to explore. That unfortunately includes the world outside and in materials. Therefore, I personally believe that allowing children to be around harmful material should be prohibited in all public libraries. The reasons for this is because explicit materials can scar a child for life. Eventually or immediately changing them forever and their path for life. That paticular child might never forget the explicit situations that are presently placed in books or movies. Secondly, most children are very gullable and are very easy to corrupt. The library shouldn't be a place for corruption, and the only way to avoid that is to eliminate the risk of such a thing. Allowing explicit things in a place where children are also greatly increases the risk of that child passing on what they saw in that item to another child. The whole class of kids could know about that specific explicit item within one hour. No person of an young age should be exposed to anything of explicit manner. Especially in a place that parents trust to be a safe place for their children to explore new things in literature. Next, I do however believe that some thing shouldn't be removed from the book selves in public libraries. Such as some gaming magazines which can be seen as an unacceptable material because of the violence and weapons. These materials should be allowed because some young boys see them as nonficitional. These items could be benefitial to their developing by allowing them to distinguish between fictional characters and nonficitional. Lastly, I think that if shopping stores that carry explicit material separate the harmful items. It should be mandatory for libraries to do the same because it is more likely for a child to spread the harmful item to their peers. Its harder for parents protect their children from from the place if they assume to be safe for them.

5485,2,"All libraries contain materials like books, music, movies magazines, etc. But is it the library's responsibility to censor their materials? In my opinion, no they shouldn't censor anything, for three reasons: the library materials are open to everyone, if a parent doesn't want their child to read or see certain things they should be the ones to prevent them from seeing or reading those things, and some of the materials that people find offensive be used for a student's research. Libraries are public buildings that provide materials for children, students, and adults and that is what they are there for. It isn't their responsibility to censor what people check out because it is the person's decision not the censors'. When a parent doesn't want their child to see something they would, most likely, try ro prevent them from seeing it again until they are a certain age. So why would they want give someone they dont really know, the responsibility to make sure their child doesn't check out inappropriate material? Why would they give their responsibilities of watching over their child to those in a library? Even though there are people there who would watch over the child, they won't be able to keep an eye on them the whole time. And lastly, some resources held at a library can be offensive, but sometimes those offensive materials are used for research. If all offensive material was monitored and taken off the shelf how would the student finish their project with no resources? So, considering what has been said in this essay, libraries shouldn't censor their materials. They are open to the public, help people find the things they want to check out, and provide numerous amounts of information for anyone to use.",7992,7993.0,All libraries contain materials like books  music  movies magazines  etc  But library s responsibility censor materials  In opinion  nt censor anything  three reasons  library materials open everyone  parent nt want child read see certain things ones prevent seeing reading things  materials people find offensive used student s research  Libraries public buildings provide materials children  students  adults  It nt responsibility censor people check person s decision censors   When parent nt want child see something would  likely  try ro prevent seeing certain age  So would want give someone dont really know  responsibility make sure child nt check inappropriate material  Why would give responsibilities watching child library  Even though people would watch child  wo nt able keep eye whole time  And lastly  resources held library offensive  sometimes offensive materials used research  If offensive material monitored taken shelf would student finish project resources  So  considering said essay  libraries nt censor materials  They open public  help people find things want check  provide numerous amounts information anyone use

5487,2,"Media has a major impact on everyone. Whether books, movies, or magazines, we almost seem to base our lives upon them. Although madia can influence adults as well, it mostly affects children. Children have not yet founded their morals or thought about later consequences. This makes children an easy target for bad influence. I am not yet a parent, but there are so many things that I would not want my child to see. Unfortunately, many of these questionable materials can be found at your local library. I believe that the public library should contain materials that will benefit our society, not make it worse. We should protect our children at the library by censoring all material, having restricted areas, or requiring adult supervision. The first option in protecting children's innocence is censoring the materials. I know not everyone who goes to the library are children, but some books, movies, and magazines should not be seen by anyone. Certain guidelines should be made on what can and cannot be put in the library. Libraries are supposed to be educational and beneficial anyways. With the media in libraries today, they cannot be classified by being educational or beneficial. The option of cendoring materials would be strongly disagreed with by most of the adult population. However, it is not the only way to make libraries kid friendly. Another way to help make libraries kid friendly is having restricted areas. If the material could be found offensive to a child, it should be placed in a specific section. This section should only be available to people who are of age. This option suits the needs of children, adults, and parents. If neither of these options have been appealing, there is still one more way to keep children protected at the library. The last way that I have thought of to keep libraries a safe place for children is to demand adult supervision. If a child is under age eighteen, they should be required to have an adult with them at the library. If the adult has any responsibility, they will monitor and limit what the child can look at. Having an adult when you're under age keeps children from keeping secrets about what they are seeing everyday. This still keeps the library the same way, but also provides some protection for children. Overall all, these options reflect ways to keep libraries a safe and healthy place for kids. I have not even come close to naming all of the options of child proofing libraries. Many other ideas could be thought of by carefully weighing the pros and cons of each option, taking little parts of each one, and putting them together to form a new option. Not changing anything in the censorship of libraries would corrupt the youth and should be considered a crime. Just as in other things, I am sure that if a child really wanted to, he or she could find a loop hole in these options. However, overall, the options I mentioned would fix the problem of corrupting children at the library",7996,7997.0,Media major impact everyone  Whether books  movies  magazines  almost seem base lives upon  Although madia influence adults well  mostly affects children  Children yet founded morals thought later consequences  This makes children easy target bad influence  I yet parent  many things I would want child see  Unfortunately  many questionable materials found local library  I believe public library contain materials benefit society  make worse  We protect children library censoring material  restricted areas  requiring adult supervision  The first option protecting children s innocence censoring materials  I know everyone goes library children  books  movies  magazines seen anyone  Certain guidelines made put library  Libraries supposed educational beneficial anyways  With media libraries today  classified educational beneficial  The option cendoring materials would strongly disagreed adult population  However  way make libraries kid friendly  Another way help make libraries kid friendly restricted areas  If material could found offensive child  placed specific section  This section available people age  This option suits needs children  adults  parents  If neither options appealing  still one way keep children protected library  The last way I thought keep libraries safe place children demand adult supervision  If child age eighteen  required adult library  If adult responsibility  monitor limit child look  Having adult re age keeps children keeping secrets seeing everyday  This still keeps library way  also provides protection children  Overall  options reflect ways keep libraries safe healthy place kids  I even come close naming options child proofing libraries  Many ideas could thought carefully weighing pros cons option  taking little parts one  putting together form new option  Not changing anything censorship libraries would corrupt youth considered crime  Just things  I sure child really wanted  could find loop hole options  However  overall  options I mentioned would fix problem corrupting children library
5488,2,"Almost any material can be found offensive depending on who the person is and what that person believes in. If all of the items that were found offensive by someone were taken off of the shelfs, then there would not be very many books remaining.If a person finds something they feel can be offensive, then they should just not check it out. There are many informative materials in the world that could be found offensive, but they can be very useful to researchers, scientists, inventors, and many other people. Many books, magazines, and movies can help mankind as a whole prevent mistakes from happening that have happened in the past. History books and movies have stories in them that are violent and very graphical. Many people become grossed out and feel it is not important and should not be shown, but if we did not know about them, then we could fall into the same mistake and cause it to happen again. Many science, biology, and health books can be called offensive by some because they show the prossesses, and go through details of many subjects that are not pleasent. We have to learn about them though so that we can know how the human body works, or how to help the body heal faster. Although the subject matter can be offensive to some, it is important that we know it, so we can help the human race. There are some materials out there that involve someones beliefs. Many people can find another religon offensive, but they can not throw the item involved with that religon away because they don't believe in it. In becuase we have the freedon of religon, we have to live with other religons and beliefs. If a library were to take a religous book off of the shelf because they didn't like it, then it would be going against the constitution. In our world today, we are all going to run into things we find offensive, but we can not just make them all go away. We have to learn how to deal with them, live with them, and ignore them.

5489,2,"Don't judge a book by its cover. This phrase means that a person should look at the book in detail rather than judge it on sterotypes and other people opinionis. Censorship in libraries is based on personal opinions and also the views of the few speaking for the many. In this case though, what would be described as offensive? Whether a book is offensive or not is a mater of opinon and not based solely on fact. A persons views and way of life affect their judgement of certain literature. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed due to its repressive nature against preserving history and also educating students about a different time. How offensive a book is be based on the personal views of a person or group of people. A book teaching the theory of evolution be offensive to a strictly christian community, but does that mean that the rest of the community would find it offensive? Censorship is a matter of opinon and as such cannot be considered legitimate within a society based on history. Censorship has affected movies as much as books. One example being the movie '@CAPS1 of the This movie portrayed the as showed during a time of racial insensitivity and progression of racism. pulled the movie from being sold due to the opinons of a few. The movie actually should have been treasured and kept alive as a preservation or historical record of the southern community during the time of slavery. If history is witheld from generations, what is to stop them from making the same mistakes again? Learn from the past to create a better future. This is a phrase overly used in the english society, but its point is true. Generations learn best from watching the mistakes of the past. If society hides the past from children, how are they going to grow up and succeed in a rapidly progressing society? Personal opinons have no place in the judgement of the legitimacy or appropriateness of a book or movie because they offer no basis of proof and also decide for the few, when the rest of the world see it differently. Some say that censorship is useful because it prevents children from reading about or watching items that influence them in a negative way. This is wrong because children will eventually read or watch something. The best way to prevent confusion is to talk about what was read or watched and explain the historical importance or social importance of the movie or book. Another belief of why censorship is useful is that it helps to control the emotional states of students. Books and movies can affect emotions but sometimes strong emotions are what change societies. If a child read a book or saw a graphic movie over the horrors of tobacco, would that not help to solve rising drug use rates? Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because it prevents the preservation of history and dictates the moral learnings of students and the public.

I can undertand why you would want to take them off of the shelves, but is that idea realistic? Three main things to think about when you want take this idea into action. One,when you pick up a book, think many people read this book everyday, including children? Two, offends you, And three, would happen if you were to take the book off of the shelves for no one else to be able to read? When you look at the first question, many people really read this book evryday. Can you really take a book off of the shelf knowing somone else loves this book, or needs it to do research? I mean there has been books before that I have had that I found certain things to be very inapropriate or offensive.But i understand there purpose. Again, I understand about your children to. There are a number of things I wouldn't want my kids to read if they were there. But They still are going to no matter It's not only in our books but in our television shows, and magazines, and even cartoons that they watch. You cannot take every book off of the shelves and every show off of the air, or every magazine out of circulation jusdt because one person found a sentance they find to be offensive. I want you to stop, close your eyes, and think. Think hard about really offends you. Now I want you to think again about kinds of things offend other people. do they match? Or did you find some things that other people wouldn't even give a second thought about? You have to put everyone into mind when you tihnk about these things. Because one thing offends one person, doent meanit has to to the rest of the world. Say something such as a blonde joke, because you yourself are a natural blonde, highly offends you. Well I myself am a natural blonde as well. But I enjoy them. So just because you would have found something offensive in a jokebook that had contained 'blonde jokes' and wanted to take it off of the shelf, you would be hurting me because I enjoyed them and thought they were funny. Now would you do that to a kid? Because you saw something you didnt like, your going to take a book away from an innocent child? Take a moment to just stop and relax. Don't try to take books away from children and everyone else because your not one hundred percent sure if you like something or not. Now on to my third question, if you were to really take books off of the shelves, music off the air, movies out of peoples homes, and magazines off of shelves, would happen? People would go straight to modern technology. Computers. Wich you know, they can also find a copy of the book. taking it off of the shelf isnt going to make it any less offensive to you.People will still be reading them jsut as much. Did you really do anything productive by taking books away? or did you jsut do something awful to the world to make yourself feel better for a minute? Im sure you kyourself has done a search online for an online movie. Everyone does. You cannot take books away to get rid of offensive materials because its everywhere. even coming out of peoples mouths. Looking back at the questions i've asked, do you really think doing this is okay? taking books and movies and even music away from the world? it's never going to change because people are happy with the way it is. If you dont like something that is in a book or in a movie or song, you yourself always have the option to put it down, change the station, or find something better to do.

5493,2,"Censorship can be necessary in certain places, just not in the library. Enforcing censorship there would only create problems, like who would do the censoring and what the criteria is. Another potential problem would be what kind of people it would be offensive to. The first problem with enforcing censorship is who will do the censoring. In books I've read, the person at the top gets the blame when others aren't happy. Also, the person could be biased against certain things that other people are fine with. The second problem with enforcing censorship is what criteria to follow. Rules made by one person normally don't go over well with the crowd as a whole. Having a committee make the rules is better, but they sometimes can't come to a unanimous decision about what is right and wrong. And taking a poll of the community wouldn't work either, since there are so many different viewpoints. The third problem with enforcing censorship is what people are offended by. One person, for example, could be fully for bloody, violent movies while another person could say that it is not humane. Everyone has a different viewpoint which could be disputed, so as the quote by author Katherine Paterson says, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' though censorship is a good thing, it isn't a practical thing to do in a library. People should be able to figure out what they find offensive and steer clear of the books they know they disagree with.

5494,2,"I do not think that a book should be removed from the shelves of a library if a few people think that the material is offensive. A library is a public place where everyone has the right to read, listen to, and watch what they want. If a child wants to read a book, the parent should be the one to decide if they can read it or not. Everyone should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what they want. They should not have that freedom taken away from them just because some people find it offensive. Everything could be taken as offensive. If every single book that had something offensive in it was taken off of the shelves at a library, there would be no books left to read. Some people are offended by things that others are not offended by at all. If someone has a problem with a book, song, movie, or magazine at a library, then they just should not read it. It is as simple as that. If a book was removed off of a shelf just because they found it offensive, that person could have just gotten someone else's favorite book removed. If I could never read my favorite book again because it was removed off of the shelves, I would be devastated. You can not complain about every little thing in life, you just have to move on. There are sections at a library for a reason. They have places for adult books, children books, teenage books, mystery, romance, humor, horror etc. Obviously some books are going to be more offensive than others. People have the right to know what kind of book they want to read before they start reading it. That is why they seperate everything into sections like that. Offensive language and actions are a part of history. Some of the best books ever written have offensive language in them. If the language was censored, it would not make the book what it was. 'To A for example, it was written when offensive language was used in just about every sentence. That offensive language was how they talked back then, and if it was removed from the book, it would be like removing a piece of history. Parents can not censor their children from everything. Once a child hits the real world after being censored from everything offensive their entire life, they will not know what to do. Everyone has to deal with a few harsh words or actions every now and then. That is how you learn to deal with them. If a parent does not want their child to read a certain book, they can censor them from reading it in their own home, it does not need to be removed off of the shelf just so that one child can not read it. In all reality, a child will do what they want to do even if they are not aloud to. Parents can try to stop them, but if a child wants to listen to a song that their parent does not like, they are going to find ways to listen to it anyway. I do not think that a parent should go out of his or her way to remove material from a library, because they are not helping anyone out by doing that. They are just going to anger people. I can understand where some parents are coming from by trying to censor things in libraries. Most are just looking out for what is best for their child. They can not censor their child from everything forever, though. Children grow up into adults. Parents might as well let their child hear or see some offensive material while they are young because this world is full of offensive things and they are going to have to get use to all of it. Books, songs, movies, and magazines that have offensive material in them should not be removed from the shelves at the library. Some people enjoy reading, listening to, and watching those things. Everyone has the right to read, listen, and watch them if they want to. It should not depend on other people's opinion over the material. The book, song, movie, or magazine was made for a reason.

5497,2,"Censorship in libraries is a very important thing to many people. Things such as religions and things should be diclosed and away from people. In other words no one wants to go to a library and see anything offensive to what they believe or stand for or any other things that make them uncomfortable. Magazines are the only things that shouldn't be censored in my opinion. Not everything you see in them are real or even close, atleast people know what to look for and what to expect with magazines. However, in a movie or a book even music things are much harder to tell. In a book you know what section to look in, what to look for, and what genre as well as music. Movies be a little more towards magazines on the censorship. As you are not in the wrong place then theres really nothing to worry about. Yes, i have once gotten into big trouble not because of what i was doing but what i was reading. I was a very small child and i didnt really know any better, but somehow i got into the adult section. This is another reason why things should be censored or even hidden. On the other hand, with children they should really watch what they put on display. Kids like to explore libraries and to see what they can see. They like to pick up uknown books, movies, magazines, and maybe even a record here and there just for their curiosity. These actions could result in their beliefs and the many questions that they have to ask. Doing this action could hurt libraries. In my personal opinion i think that religious books shouldn't be on shelves, you should have to order then. Although, this be my opinon another person refelect on something totally different. Now days there is no tellin what people consider as offensive. These statements could push until there are no longer libraries or books to read. People stop publishing and writting books because they are to scared of them not selling, that could hurt a lot of readers and authors. This act could also affect the lack of education. Everyone should have the right to read and look at what they want as well as hear what they desire. Censorship is a good and bad thing, it's very important to do but they should just do that in private libraries. If anyone is so worried about them or their child seeing, hearing, or reading something that they don't wat them to then don't take them to a public library.

This is how we sort our selves out amongst this world. Libraries, to me, are places to fullfill fantasies or dreams that people have by showing them how other people live there life, or showing someone what they want the most. Music is sometimes often a definition of a person and or their personality. Movies are to depict many things, but they are made to make people feel whatever emotion suits them at the time.

Just because one person isn't okay with a certain thought or idea contradicting their belief or ideas, does not mean someone who thinks differently than that person does not want to read.

5500,2,"'@CAPS1 is this remarked his suprised mother. 'I can not believe you have magazines of naked girls in your room!' sat silently as his mother knew he was embarrassed. 'I found all of these magazines at the library.' said softly. His mother was so furious that she wanted to call the library and give them a piece of her mind, but she kept calm and instead had a talk with Do you think these magazines such as nudity, violence, drinking, and even racial comments should be given out to people? Some people love these kind of things, and some people absolutely hate them. Everybody has their own opinion. Many people have addictions to magazines with nudity or jokes about different races. Some people might say they need these magazines because boys have so many hormones and they need some way to release these hormones. There are also many companies that sell pornographic videos or magazines that make a lot of money and people can not simply make them stop selling their only source of income, since it is not illegal. This on going battle could be compared to the case of the tobacco companies. Their products were bad for many people and were forced to put labels on their products warning people of the risks. Although this is a lot harder to do because this is not harming anyone in any way. This is against some peoples' beliefes though, which is not fare if libraries are letting these products be checked out. Books or videos that contain pornographic pictures have a law that you must be eighteen years old to purchase or view these items, but in some cases there is nudity in everyday magazines that your kid could be looking at. There is also violence, racial, and alcohol advertisments that your kids are exposed to also. Some parents could say that they do not want their kids looking at such things. So could we do about this? One solution is you have to be eighteen years old to buy any kind of magazine or video that contains violence, alcohol, or nudity. A conflict we might run into is that some companies would suffer from this law, such as the magazine seventeen. This magazine is targeted to draw in teenagers to buy their products. There are solutions to this though. We could either make sure they have nothing that is inappropriate in the products, or we could have someones' parents buy the product. This would give parental consent if the parents bought it, also if they did not like was in the magazine then they would not have to buy it. Many things can be said about this issue and I have only addressed one of my own ideas. I think that this idea is very reasonable and could be done. As a seventeen year old high school student that is a tri-athlete, when i have kids I do not want them viewing the violent, nude, or acoholic advertisements when they are only young.

5502,2,"Why is Censorship In our daily lives, we are subjected to many examples of offensive language, acts, or gestures. We can find such critisism in almost everything we see and hear. I believe that censorship is not a wise decision, because it must fill the needs of every race, religion, country, etc. If this happens, then our books, movies, magazines, etc. selections will be scarse or even none. I ultimatley believe that certain materials on the shelves should include offensive material, because that is the way our culture is today with all the politics and disputes. If we censor all the books, then what will be left besides childrens novels and just bland old facts. There are too many books that have at least a line of offensive material. For instance, 'To a a very good example of offensive language, because the main characters still use the word 'nigger' to reveal their feelings about a black man in the novel. It shows us that in the days, such as the setting in this story, people didn't know that offensive language like 'nigger' was so because that was what they were taught. Another example is of the movie, '@CAPS4 the were the young black men are subjected to harsh criticism, because of the color of their skin. In all, I believe that it would be a wise decision to keep such books and movies on the shelves to appeal to the people. I also believe that the censorship, if taken into full effect, would be too diverse, because of countries such as were many different races, religions, colors, etc. can come together to form sucha magnificiant nation. If you were to censor all the books, movies, magazines, news articles, or what ever; you would have to fill the needs of all the verieties of people, for this is what they choose to read and watch. The criticism in our today is almost part of our culture. We have been subjected to offensive material since the day we could read, and hopefully it will last until we die. This is who we are as a nation, or better a united We need this offensive material. All this offensive lanuage and gestures is a teaching lesson to show people of all gender and age that we should not partake in actions that dehumanize other fellow human beings. We are supposed to be taught at an early age that using offensive language is We can learn all of this in the offensive novels, films, or advertisments that we encounter in a normal day. We should learn to deal with the criticizing literature, because we do not want to end up like a communist communtiy where everyone has equal rights, money, and lives, such as in the novel that I am reading now, called '@CAPS7 by In this story, the main characters job was to burn all of the books to ensure that the equality in his new age lives would be sustained. This is also true with the author's, Katherine Paterson, view that if one person can take a an offensive book off the shelf, then everone can do the same, and we wouldn't be able to read much, for everyone can find offense in almsot any book. I don't like this idea for it is too drastic, beacuse these authors have taken too much time to write these teaching stories and movies to help better our look on offensive material. Ultimately, I refuse to believe that our will become like the one in '@CAPS7 but we'll never know. It seems in our today, that every movie we waych or every book we pick up, there is an example of offense. I just don't think that offensive material is that big of a comotion to get all worked up about.

The reason I say this is because; just because someone see's something the wrong way dosen't mean everyone else does. If you have a problem with your child getting those type of things make sure they don't check them out at libraries. In addition to that you can go to the library with them to see what type of things your child is interested in. The reason I say this is because whats good for your child be good for someone else's child. Instead of judging the material that you think your kids should see you should take the time to understand what it is all about. For example my father would let me read or watch '@CAPS1 books or movies, until one day my older cousin was aware of this and bought me a series of his books and then my father took the timwe to see what it was about then he ended up likeing it and bought me the video game. That is why you should expose your children to all material but some material early. I say this because no matter how many times you tell a child no they are still going to try to get hold of the books, movies, or magazines that you do want them to see. In conclusion you keep those materials on the shelfs because your child can still get exposed to it in todays society.",8028,8029.0,Should certain books  movies  magazines removed book shelves  In opinion  The reason I say  someone see s something wrong way dose nt mean everyone else  If problem child getting type things make sure nt check libraries  In addition go library see type things child interested  The reason I say whats good child good someone else s child  Instead judging material think kids see take time understand  For example father would let read watch   CAPS books movies  one day older cousin aware bought series books father took timwe see ended likeing bought video game  That expose children material material early  I say matter many times tell child still going try get hold books  movies  magazines want see  In conclusion keep materials shelfs child still get exposed todays society 
5504,2,"In our world today, we are minors and everyone are exposed to all kinds of inapropriate material. From books to movies, there will always be those ones that contain said content. If we were to do anything about this, it would have to be a pretty big change for some people, being that there are people in our society that are exposed to inapropriate content every day. On the other hand, material that some people might find to be offensive be steping stones and knowledge for other people. Things should be removed from the shelves of libraries, but only certain things. We have all at some point in our lives have been exposed to some kind of offensive material. In libraries and book stores, you can almost always find some kind of inapropriate reading material, movies, music, and magazines. A library is open to the general public, which in turn means that little children can enter thes libraries and be expsed to this kind of content. I'm sure for most parents, they wouldn't want their kids to see, and hear that kind of stuff. It is of my beleif that material such as porn, and vulgar material should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. If they are not able to be disposed of, then they should at least be given to some pritave seller, or put them some place where they are not open to the general public. However, there are some kinds of material that should be kept on the shelf. On the topic of sex, there are many books out there that have pornography mateiral in them, and this is not good at all for the children because it gives the false perceptions on what sex is supposed to be.

Every person has their own thoughts and beliefs. There are six billion people in this world ;consquently, there are many different opinions and different types of people. What one person finds offensive another will not. If these products are censored a bias world will emerge and there will only be one opinion, which is basically a dictatorship. Music artist, movie producers, an authors all produce products that they think will sell to a particular group of people. They have different genres of their product to appeal to different groups of people. This makes everybody happy because they can go see a movie about their favorite sport or read a book about their favorite singer. Without these different genres everyone wouldn't know about their intrests. If they censored these products many people would not be able to learn or listen to the things that they like, which results in many angry people. Poeple can censor their own lifes but not an entire nation. If a parent doesnt like a particular author or artist they can prevent their child from buying their books or downloading their music, but because one parent doesnt like it that doesnt mean that they can controll another who doesnt care if their child listens to that type of music or reads the authors books. Someone can not control anothers life just because of what they believe. You can control your life and only yours. If the government censored these products many jobs and intrests would be lost.

5507,2,"Are to strict these days? Censorship has been happening more and more during the past couple of decades. How would you feel if your life story was to be alter just because you were in the war and you made some mistakes? Would you like people to say your life inside 'the image they are trying to protry', or 'Your life story isnt good enough?' i go any furthur , I want to define censorship so we have a sense of the meaning. Censorship is where something being a book or anything really gets changed to prevent others from seeing or hearing. Now do I think all censorship is wrong? No. Do I think alot has gotten out of hand? Abosolulty. Honestly I think censorship is a good thing to a certain extent. Of course i dont want little kids and children to read books or written articles that might be in a library to read about 'teen and adult subjects.' I think there should be age limts to these books and such just like everything theses days have. I dont think my war story should be in the hands of a year old. these days act as if books that say one or two curse words should be prohibited at schools. They also think books with sex, drugs, or alchol shouldnt be read at school, because 'thier' kids are ready for it but in the 'real world' teenagers already now of this stuff and have either been exposed to it or have at least heard about it. Kids do things behind thier back because do talk to them and be open and up front with them. Now im saying people should be ok with kids drinking, having sex, and doing drugs but should kids be allows to read a book about it sure. Now should people that pour their heart and soul into a book be shuned away because 'your kid shouldnt read it?' No. There should be where the age limt laws come into play. Now if it is within the age limit for your kid and you still dont like it talk to them about it and punish them in your own way, but dont make others suffer because you dont like the book. This page is just what I think, but please dont ruin books for me and others because your belifs, if you see a book you dont like just move on to the next one, no one is making you read a book you do agree with.

5508,2,"'@CAPS1 mommy look at these neat pictures!' '@CAPS2 did you get that?!' '@CAPS3 the library mommy.' I have seen a situation like this one and this conversation is bound to come up if there is absolutely no censorship in libraries. But is full censorship the best for everyone? Indeed there always needs to be some censorship but should it be the same for a toddler and a thirty year old man? Libraries should enforce a special 'selective censorship.'Libraries have the right to ban any material or genre from their shelves. For this reason, libraries could be highly bias on any topic. I have seen libraries a hefty percentage of materials is from one author or from one genre. Since the libraries have this power, should the people that attend the library be forced to have the same views as the people running it? This is why libraries should have selective censorship.With selective censorship, it can allow everyone from every age group to become satisfied with the material on the shelves of their library. This type of censorship would require responsibility not only from the library, but from the community as well. The library would have to take responsibility and not allow certain age groups to check out certain materials. The community would have to take responsibility to help decide what materials should be in the library. There are multiple ways for the community to accomplish this task.One way for this to happen is to have regular library meetings for people in the community to help decide. At these meetings, they could talk about the materials they are planning on obtaining and the residents of the community would state any objections to the selection, and if none, then the library would be free to obtain that piece of literature. This way of deciding would work well until the community stopped attending the decision meetings. If the community gave up on their responsibility then it would go back to the old ways of the library deciding. The community could also conquer this task by having book club meetings for reading ethusists and these members could help the library decide what is best. Since these members are familiar with many types of writing and authors, they would be most suitable for the position.Libraries can be a place for everyone to be satisfied with the materials, but only if everyone takes responsibility. The community can be a major factor in deciding what comes through the doors of the library if only they take initiative and help. The library system has done an adept job with providing sufficient material to the community thus far and will continue to fill the shelves with adaquet selections. But, I believe, communities should come together and decide what goes into libraries like they decide what happens in the school system. So go out and take the initiative of telling the community about how they can help to get selective censorship into your public library.",8038,8039.0,  CAPS mommy look neat pictures     CAPS get      CAPS library mommy   I seen situation like one conversation bound come absolutely censorship libraries  But full censorship best everyone  Indeed always needs censorship toddler thirty year old man  Libraries enforce special selective censorship  Libraries right ban material genre shelves  For reason  libraries could highly bias topic  I seen libraries hefty percentage materials one author one genre  Since libraries power  people attend library forced views people running  This libraries selective censorshipWith selective censorship  allow everyone every age group become satisfied material shelves library  This type censorship would require responsibility library  community well  The library would take responsibility allow certain age groups check certain materials  The community would take responsibility help decide materials library  There multiple ways community accomplish taskOne way happen regular library meetings people community help decide  At meetings  could talk materials planning obtaining residents community would state objections selection  none  library would free obtain piece literature  This way deciding would work well community stopped attending decision meetings  If community gave responsibility would go back old ways library deciding  The community could also conquer task book club meetings reading ethusists members could help library decide best  Since members familiar many types writing authors  would suitable positionLibraries place everyone satisfied materials  everyone takes responsibility  The community major factor deciding comes doors library take initiative help  The library system done adept job providing sufficient material community thus far continue fill shelves adaquet selections  But  I believe  communities come together decide goes libraries like decide happens school system  So go take initiative telling community help get selective censorship public library

5510,2,"Whether or not libraries remove certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. depends on how much a certain piece of literature means to someone.Removing a certain book or piece of literature from a library shelf, be the same as losing a big peice of your childhood. It all be gone without that certain book, movie, music, or something just plain special to you. It's just wrong.If someone had a special childhood with a certain movie or book, and one day someone said, 'oh this book is way to unappropriate, remove it!' that just be the end of it? We should just automatically do what were told, imagine how that person feel about losing that movie or book.Maybe all they could afford was going to the library and they didn't have enough money to own it. Just because a few people think it's offensive doesn't mean that you should automatically remove it but if it's really offensive like for say having a unappropriate book for children in the children's section then it probably be best to remove it, or at least come to an agreement about moving it to the adult section.If you really find so much offense to something libraries have bring it up with someone in charge, ask about it. Just don't start making a big deal about it right away. Don't get me wrong some of the magazines for men that libraries have are quite disgusting, but not everyone finds offense to it. If you don't like it don't read it!Senior citizens don't really care for some of the cartoons now a days that kids enjoy and watch almost every single day, and we haven't removed them from televison so why should we remove some things from libraries? We shouldn't! It irriates me just seeing some of the people that walk into a local library, take a look at a book and then just have a face full of disgust just by looking at the cover. The saying ' never judge a book by its cover' fits all to well in this. Just because it looks like it's going to be a dirty or disgusting,book,movie,magazine,etc.. doesn't mean it really is.I'm not the only one who feels this way but i'm also not the only one who has an argument about this subject, other people have different opinions no one is the same.

5511,2,"Yes, some books,magazines,movies should be removed. None of the grown ups want their little ones or children to be reading those kind of nasty books or things of that sort. Children should not see naked people on the covers of things or books. Ive acutally walked into a magazine place and saw maybe eight or nine year olds looking at nasty stuff that was not suitable for their ages. Like come on those kind of things should not been seen by little ones like them; like on video games killing old people and running people over with their cars. some parents are acutally scared that their children will grow up and do that; get put into jail or worst. But then again some people dont care or do care in certain ways that their children learn about stuff like that to be safe. Besides some children are mature enough to watch and play or read these kind of stuff because they arent going to do theirselves. Some take as just a book, game or magazine and leave at that. Ok when i was little i was watching scary movies like and the doll movies. Yes I was scared alittle but all was good. I even played some violent video games like grand theift auto. But i didnt go out and killl an old lady and steal their cars. You never know out maybe their is a kid killing people off the street proclaming they learned from the provocative video game or movie.

5513,2,"Many people might think that having censored books, magazines, and ect., could be a excellent thing so the books that have certain materials in them could not offen them. Removing the books from the shelves can might or might not be the right thing to do. Many people might want to learn more about the consquences of those certain books that might be offensive to others. In school, public places, or at home those books are being read, talked about, or listened. Therefore the thing that should be done is to remove the books if they are goin to cause problems. In school, talking about the books that we have read might be a good way to communicate with others, but if its about those certain books some teens might be offened. The best way to avoid making comments about the book the and offening others would be to think before speaking. I've seen how students get offened by others opinions on the books they have read. For example if my friend was and my other friend read a book about people and how they got treated in the past and would make a horrible comment about I easily know that would be upset and would not forgive her. First of all, it's like if someone close to me was talking about my religion and made a horrible comment I would get mad and not be happy about it. I have seen how my own friends offen each other because of the books and magazines they read, but at the end they apologize to each othe rand everything is excellent with their friendship. During public palces might not be a good idea to talk about certain books, magazine, music, and ect., because people that might like those books might get offened with the comments that are being said. In a public place you can observe people reading, listening to music, or watching movies on their portable laptops. If someone passes by and listens or hears the type of music you like and they dislike the music, the first thing he or she is going to do is critize the type of music and then you. Although there are other people that might like that type of music and make a splendid comment and would critize you in a good way, unlike others that wouldn't. People, especially teens, are the ones that would critize you on the music, movies, books, ect., that have certain materials. Teens would probably think horrible about your aspects on the materials you read, hear, or listen to. While being at home the better thing to is to read those certain books away from little siblings. For example if your reading something that might be offened to little siblings or your parents the thing to do is to read it in your room or somewhere were your family isn't near. For example if your little brother comes home and sees you reading something that might offen your mom or dad just put the material away. Reading those certain materials might get you into trouble and probably the best thing to do is to not read them at home and just read them somewhere else. There could be several reasons why you shouldn't have those materials home, but it is better to have them away from home. Inconclusion, there are many ways to offen people with those certain materials. Some people believe that they should be removed away from library shelves and I agree. Having those books, magazines, music, movies, ect., can cause alot of harm to others including the ones you love. It's better to have them remove because that way teens or kids can not have those kinds of influences while they grow up.

5514,2,"There are millions of books out in the world, and many more being published all the time. So many different categories of media are out today, and so many different places to come across them. Although some people do not enjoy reading in any form, it is still a task done nearly everyday by almost everyone. Most media centers in schools, especially elementary schools do not have music or movies, and sometimes not even magazines. When one walks into a school library, even at a high school, one does not imagine the first book he will come across will be about homosexuals, offensiveness to different races, or murder. Today those subjects even in school libraries are becoming more common. I think that different ages should be allowed different types of exposures to things. It is up to the parents to teach their children to make the right choices about what they expose themselves to when parents are not present. When people of all ages come across reading just anything and everything all the time, it might make one wonder if more things should be kept more in private, rather than out for the world to read, see, or hear. In public libraries there are children sections and several other sections that separate the different subjects of media, which is great. Authors are not going to stop writing what some call 'inappropriete' so it is up to the public to sensor what they want to be exposed to themselves. I do not believe that materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves, even if they do come across as offensive. I do not want my nine year old sister to read about drugs and murder, but if that is my wish; then it is up to me to shelter her from that. It should not be a librarians responsibility to remove any small thing that be offensive to someone, if it were, there most likely would not be many books on the shelf frankly. People have tons of responsibilities to tend to daily and removing from shelves what be helpful to one person, just because it offends another is not ethical. Children should be sensored in media, but sensoring them mean not taking a trip to the library with your children one day, not asking for what you find offensive to be removed. Out of so many different types of media found today, there are more than enough different choices. I am sure people can find at least one out of many that is not offensive",8050,8051.0,There millions books world  many published time  So many different categories media today  many different places come across  Although people enjoy reading form  still task done nearly everyday almost everyone  Most media centers schools  especially elementary schools music movies  sometimes even magazines  When one walks school library  even high school  one imagine first book come across homosexuals  offensiveness different races  murder  Today subjects even school libraries becoming common  I think different ages allowed different types exposures things  It parents teach children make right choices expose parents present  When people ages come across reading anything everything time  might make one wonder things kept private  rather world read  see  hear  In public libraries children sections several sections separate different subjects media  great  Authors going stop writing call inappropriete  public sensor want exposed  I believe materials books  music  movies  magazines removed shelves  even come across offensive  I want nine year old sister read drugs murder  wish  shelter  It librarians responsibility remove small thing offensive someone   likely would many books shelf frankly  People tons responsibilities tend daily removing shelves helpful one person  offends another ethical  Children sensored media  sensoring mean taking trip library children one day  asking find offensive removed  Out many different types media found today  enough different choices  I sure people find least one many offensive
5515,2,"I believe materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be allowed in libraries because people have their own opinon about things.

Actually, just a few days ago my mom's friend called her saying her daughter brought home this inappropreite book from her school library. It really was to mature for middle schoolers. She read my mom a few lines from the book, it was about a meth addict who wrote the book and told people how he got money for drugs. I think that those kind of books are for adults, not for middle schooler children. That is why there are different sections in a library, the adult section, adolesent section, and the children section. If the books are found offensive take them back and get new books to read. I really don't see why people make such a huge scene about something that isn't bad at all. Don't sit there and talk about it all day get up and do something about it! The most thing I think about when people read really mature books is, that you always have to remember everyone's maturity levels are all different, so one book could be okay for an eighth grader but the next one that goes in there to pick up the same book might be to immature about the book. So, when people pick books, it's all about the maturity level of the people.

5516,2,"Some people believe that censorship in works of art such as literature, music, artwork, and movies is necessary. Many disagree on what is appropriate to be shown and heard and seen, and what is not. Honestly, it depends on the age group. Younger children have more impressionable minds and are definately in need of censorship. However, older audiences should know right from wrong and should be able to watch or see or read whatever they want. In libraries censorship is not needed at all. The simplest thing one can do is split the materials up into groups, like chilren, young adults, and adults. Then there is no hassle about what someone's child have picked up and took home from the library. There is a section devoted to the materials viewed as appropriate for children. Of course, as children, the content of books and movies and music from the library should be censored as the parents see fit. If it's just a chapter book with no pictures, a young child will not really understand what is going on, because there are no pictures. However, it's still pretty vital to watch what a child be reading, because the book contain inappropriate words that one would normally punish the child for saying. Graphic picture books, on the other hand, prove to cause more damage to a child's mind. Pictures and sight are how children learn, and if it's all blood and violence, the child be emotionally scarred or changed in some way. Then again, the child still not be able to understand what is going on in the picture. And if those bad words or graphic pictures are kept from the child until they are mature enought to look at them, then they'll be fine. Young adults and adults can handle more graphic stuff that children. No censorship is needed, unless the parent of the young adult wishes the child to be a fourty-year-old virgin. Cases of this do happen, but the teen will just find a way to the content anyways, especially if it is forbidden. Most teens and young adults and adults know enough to understand appropriate actions from inappropriate actions. So if something violent happens in a book or there's grapic pictures, it's acceptable for them to read or see. They'll know that they're not allowed to go be a serial killer, or rape somebody or something. However, how one reacts to books read from a library all stems back to how they were taught as children, and how they matured. In most cases, censorship is downright ridiculous and unnecessary. Now, a way to make everybody happy on both sides of this argument. It's simple, because all the library has to do is organize its content into age-group-friendly sections. Sectors of child-friendly texts, with their happy colorful picture books like anything by and funny book series, like '@PERSON2 the and '@CAPS2'. Also a section for young adults/ teens, because even though teens like to think that they can be up for anything, and are allowed to read anything, most parents don't want their teen reading a romance novel with a multitude of raunchy sex chapters. So innapropriate romance novels, gone. The average teen likes to read book that they can relate to, so books based on a teenager's life and what happens to them go there also. Next comes the adult section. Absolutely anything can go here, because adults are viewed as mature as one is able to get and can handle anything they read. The romances fit in quite well here. Censorship in libraries is an idea that would leave a library bookless, and that defeats the whole point of a library. Parents would come raging through and take out all the books that they don't like or don't see fit for their children, and other people would take out anything that they didn't like too. A library is supposed to be a place where you can find some sort of information on anything, and a book in every genre by almost every author. Chilren obviously need to be limited on what they read, but teens and adults have more freedom. The most reasonable solution to make both sides happy is to break the book up into sections, where each age group can be happy with what they get, and the parents can be happy as well. No material should be removed or banned from a library because of content. There should always be a place for any book in a library, because a library is where books of all kinds belong.",8054,8055.0,Some people believe censorship works art literature  music  artwork  movies necessary  Many disagree appropriate shown heard seen   Honestly  depends age group  Younger children impressionable minds definately need censorship  However  older audiences know right wrong able watch see read whatever want  In libraries censorship needed  The simplest thing one split materials groups  like chilren  young adults  adults  Then hassle someone s child picked took home library  There section devoted materials viewed appropriate children  Of course  children  content books movies music library censored parents see fit  If s chapter book pictures  young child really understand going  pictures  However  s still pretty vital watch child reading  book contain inappropriate words one would normally punish child saying  Graphic picture books  hand  prove cause damage child s mind  Pictures sight children learn  s blood violence  child emotionally scarred changed way  Then  child still able understand going picture  And bad words graphic pictures kept child mature enought look  ll fine  Young adults adults handle graphic stuff children  No censorship needed  unless parent young adult wishes child fourtyyearold virgin  Cases happen  teen find way content anyways  especially forbidden  Most teens young adults adults know enough understand appropriate actions inappropriate actions  So something violent happens book s grapic pictures  s acceptable read see  They ll know re allowed go serial killer  rape somebody something  However  one reacts books read library stems back taught children  matured  In cases  censorship downright ridiculous unnecessary  Now  way make everybody happy sides argument  It s simple  library organize content agegroupfriendly sections  Sectors childfriendly texts  happy colorful picture books like anything funny book series  like   PERSON   CAPS   Also section young adults teens  even though teens like think anything  allowed read anything  parents nt want teen reading romance novel multitude raunchy sex chapters  So innapropriate romance novels  gone  The average teen likes read book relate  books based teenager s life happens go also  Next comes adult section  Absolutely anything go  adults viewed mature one able get handle anything read  The romances fit quite well  Censorship libraries idea would leave library bookless  defeats whole point library  Parents would come raging take books nt like nt see fit children  people would take anything nt like  A library supposed place find sort information anything  book every genre almost every author  Chilren obviously need limited read  teens adults freedom  The reasonable solution make sides happy break book sections  age group happy get  parents happy well  No material removed banned library content  There always place book library  library books kinds belong 
5517,2,"If one walked into any local public library on a weekly basis, they know one thing for a fact. The place is organized. This makes it easy to be in and out of the library in a period of time that is reasonably short. It is that same organization that marks clearly what material is for children and what is for adults. Many adults are concerned for the innocence of their children when it comes to what can be found on the library shelves. In some cases, adults want items removed from the library. Censorship is unneccesary however, if a minute amount of common sense is exercised by both library employees who organize the place and the adults that raise their children. There would be one easy way to eliminate the need for library censorship, and that would be for those who run the system and work in it everyday to know what they have. One wouldn't have to run the risk of children finding something explicit in the library if it was reviewed and removed before it was put on the shelf in the first place. If those employed by the library were proactive and knew they had, then they could keep blatantly illegal things out of the hands of children. This applys to pornography or any other sexually explicit material. With parents who are both authoritative and permisive comes a great deal of grey area. Some parents care deeply about what could be termed 'suggestive content,' while others couldn't care less about it. One example of this would be a book that references two people having sex without going into detail or drawing any atention to it. To some parents, the passive message would be an instant red flag. Other parents might not care because the same thing can be found in movies and television all of the time. Parent discrestion plays a huge role in all types of media seen by the child in or out of the library. A parent who is restrictive might put child locks on their television, while other parents will let the child watch as they please. The same principle works in the library. Everyone parents differently and those who are hardliners about suggestive media will in turn keep a closer eye on their children, but it is their responcibility. The responcibilty for what the child can find in the library rests on the parent once the library is organized. Organization will prevent so many issues, and make it easy for strict parents to keep a hold on what their child views. In many libraries, there are sections that are clearly marked as being for kids and adults, and those who work at the library should know what kind of material is in each. The obvious way to know where to file a piece of media is to look over it, and if a book or anything else might prove compromising to young children, it should be placed in an adult section where a responcible adult will then keep their child from accessing it if they so choose. What the children can and can't read is not the responcibilty of the librarian. Their responcibilty is to organize material so adults can then make clear decisions on what their children can view. Preventing children from seeing things the parent doesn't want them to is of course, the job of the parent. The librarian can assist by keeping things organized, but after that has been done, it falls into the court of the adult. Nothing needs to be removed from an organized library and it should cator to all people whether they are strict or not. Through a little planning, knowledge, organization, and parent responcibility, censorship in libraries has been and will continue to be unneccesary in most libraries.",8056,8057.0,If one walked local public library weekly basis  know one thing fact  The place organized  This makes easy library period time reasonably short  It organization marks clearly material children adults  Many adults concerned innocence children comes found library shelves  In cases  adults want items removed library  Censorship unneccesary however  minute amount common sense exercised library employees organize place adults raise children  There would one easy way eliminate need library censorship  would run system work everyday know  One would nt run risk children finding something explicit library reviewed removed put shelf first place  If employed library proactive knew  could keep blatantly illegal things hands children  This applys pornography sexually explicit material  With parents authoritative permisive comes great deal grey area  Some parents care deeply could termed suggestive content   others could nt care less  One example would book references two people sex without going detail drawing atention  To parents  passive message would instant red flag  Other parents might care thing found movies television time  Parent discrestion plays huge role types media seen child library  A parent restrictive might put child locks television  parents let child watch please  The principle works library  Everyone parents differently hardliners suggestive media turn keep closer eye children  responcibility  The responcibilty child find library rests parent library organized  Organization prevent many issues  make easy strict parents keep hold child views  In many libraries  sections clearly marked kids adults  work library know kind material  The obvious way know file piece media look  book anything else might prove compromising young children  placed adult section responcible adult keep child accessing choose  What children ca nt read responcibilty librarian  Their responcibilty organize material adults make clear decisions children view  Preventing children seeing things parent nt want course  job parent  The librarian assist keeping things organized  done  falls court adult  Nothing needs removed organized library cator people whether strict  Through little planning  knowledge  organization  parent responcibility  censorship libraries continue unneccesary libraries 
5518,2,"There are many types of offensive materials waiting to be checked out at local libraries. I feel that if libraries were to take out all of the offensive materials it wouldn't be fair to the people. I believe that this wuold upset teenagers, adults and other customers, because they should be able to check out what they want. It is very understandable that with todays society there are many conflicts and many offensive movies, books, magazines etc. swarming our local libraries and waiting to be checked out or skimmed through. Although racial comments, and other negative things that are said and written down are very offensive to some people, it's part of how the is today, let alone the world. It seem to be a good idea to take anything offensive out of libraries, but in all reality that would be taking away materials from the public. It would also be stripping libraries of their 'voice'. I believe that everything in a library contains a voice. A opinion, facts, comments, some of these be very hurtful and others make you rethink the way you judge everythinng around us. I think that libraries should contain all types of materials, offensive or not. It's not fair to take away the voice from libraries.Yes, libraries can take away offensive materials out of respect for people, but no one can really hide from the offensive things said outloud or displayed on televison.Library partons deserve to be able to check out what they want, if it's offensive to them or anyone else.

5519,2,"Some libraries are so censored, right? well not this one that is located in when I first walked in I seen many many different things that I have never seen in another library. When I looked around I was amazed in good ways and in some not so good ways. There was naked people in some books, some sexual activity being talked about in books. There was even people who were deceased in some books as well. Now I can see if your talking about a loved one who has passed away or anything in that nature but I just can't see pictures of the person who is dead and how they died. Some things just get really gory in library. Oh, and by the way the library was called 'No In my opinion, that was a great name. If a young child walked into that library, it isn't very professional or something a child should see nor learn about at all. Thats more of an adult library, children should not be allowed. On the other hand, it isnt a bad library for people who like that type of stuff either. In that case, I won't sit here and talk about 'No They do have regular books like teenage stuff and scary stories you know, that aren't really scary, and the teenage high school stuff. Thats a plus side of the library I would say. Even if you want to just go look around or do some research on an animal or a human being is good for going to 'No as well. But in my case I wouldn't step foot in the library for no other reason then to do some research. Enough about that library though I've been to a lot of them. I would have to say my favorite one is a library in It's kind of like a comic library, or should I say they have a lot of funny books commical magazines and that sort of stuff. because I think funny books. I know how I was just talking about things being too uncensored but this library gosh it can use a little bit of help. I mean they don't even cuss in the books at all.

5520,2,"Katherine Paterson, has stated a quote about books off the self that are bad for our children. I believe that censorship in libraries is a good idea. There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that are not good for some people to read or hear about. Some people do not realize what they are reading and what they are watching. Censorship for book, is a good way to keep people from knowing about things they do not need to know about. For example, little children do not need to be reading a book that has foul language or sexual contenet in the material. This would not be apporpriate for them to read. these krinds of books out of there reach is a good idea so they do not go around cusing and talking about sexual things. Also, not just little children that people are worried about, they are also worried about people knowing things that they should not know about. Another example, while at war, librarians would take books off the shelf. Therefore, people did not know what was going on and they could not know what was happening. Katherine Paterson once stated, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from a shelf- that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The author is stating that if we take away the bad books that should not be read, then there will be no books for any of us to read. She also satates, that if you have the right to take them away then you need to do so if you think it is bad. If you had all the books in the world, and went to take out all of the offensive and not appopriate ones off the self, what would be left? Books have lots of meaning behind them and they also have good and bad meaning to them. books that are bad or offinsive in anyway, off the shelf, be a smart idea. You see children today, that are learning about things that they should not know yet. You think, 'wow' I never knew what they know at there age. You have just learned about it, and they are younger and already know about it. Trying to take music that is bad or offensive away, be a little harder to do. People are still going to want to listen to that music, if it is taken away. There is not just bad music, there is lots of good music that could be listening to. It is that person listening to the music opinion to what they decide on. Everyone, is different in there own ways. Music, just as any other book, magazine, or even movie, is a personal opinion. away the bad music, to try to cut back on what people think about, is a good way of solving the problem. The problem is that too many young people, do not understand what many things mean. It is ok for these young children to not understand what everything means. Just because they do not know what something means, does not make them dumb. They have many years to learn what somethings mean in life. Katherine Paterson, has made a very agurable point. If you have the ability to take something away that is bad, them do it. But just be aware that when you are finished, there not be anything left for other people to learn aabout. Take movies as an example. Movies have many offesive ideas in them, but when them away, you have to think is this one movie worth away. If not them leave it, there are plenty of worse movies out there, to take away. Watching a movie, is different then reading a book. In a book, you can make an image in your head of the setting, whereas in a movie the setting is playing on a screen for you already. In a movie, you do not have to think about what to imagine in your head, which you not have to use your brain. In a book, you have to imagine a setting of the story that is happening, and you have to use your brain to think about what is going on and what is happening. Therefore, movies and books that are bad off the market or the self is a good plan, if you do not want your children learning about things that you do not even know about. All these examples, are a good way to support that these materials off the self is a good idea in my opinion. Katherine a clear point, that she believes that if she has the abilitty to take the materials off the shelf that are offensive, that she will. But on the other hand she also knows that when she is finished picking out all the offensive material, there you not have any books left on the shelf for anyone else. In conclusion, all the bad, offensive, and sexual content off the selfs be challenging, but if that is what you are wanting, then you have the ability just as anyone elae has the ability. Once again, Katherine Paterson states, ' All off us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.

5523,2,"Cameron Censorship in Libraries if a child got ahold of a book that he or she was to young to understand the material was about? I feel it is important to have censorship in libraries. If the libraries are not censoring their material, it is up to the parents to watch and see their children are looking at in libraries. Not only is it the parents job it is also the teachers in our schools job to watch out for the children in their school's library. Libraries should take some books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelf. Libraries need to face the fact that not all the books in their libraries are right for kids.

Parents should encourage their children to read, but they should take time out to go to the library with their kids. If the parents show their kids to read it could help. if the kids go to library with some friends? They can easily go and get some books that are not suggested for kids. Once again it all comes back to the libraries. This is also why it is so very important for parents to get into their child's reading life. Not only should the parents be responsible, but the teachers can some chnge the ideas of kids look at. If teachers show their students books for their own age group, it can help in the students next decision for a book to read.

5524,2,"Honestly, no they should not take a book, magazine, or any kind of media off the shelf unless it is damaged too much. so if a disc is scratched and constantly freezes or doesnt even get read by the scanner in the drive, then its time to throw it away. if a book is torn and/or the cover is missing, then its time to throw it away. My reason for my statement is farely simple. I'll start it off with the fact that your taking away a selection of stuff away from the shelf. I know that there was alot of contraversy about whether or not the book series '@CAPS1 ought to be sold publicly or not because of its detail of witchcraft and wizardry. People said it was offensive to their religion. But books like these that are very popular and are number one sellers are economy boosters and get more publicity to the library. Another reason is what if parents dont want their kids to get a book the has curse-words in it or some kind of adult content within its pages. Then parents should ask the employees of thelibrary if there is an option for age restrictions that can be applied to a childs library card or account to keep them from viewing mature books. If there is no such thing then just simply tell your child that they are not to check out any book with inaproppriate material. If a parent cannot trust their child to follow those directions then they should check what their child brings home from the library. If they are worried that their child be viewing inaproppriate material while they are at the library then the parent should simply just go to the library with their child. If a parent cannot make time to go to the library with their children then maybe its time for the child to use the school's media-center or not go to the library at all. My point is, is that others should not suffer the reprocussions of one child because their parent does not like what they have an option to read. And in all honesty its just stupid to do something like that. thats taking away freedom of what people can read. Maybe that person doesnt have the money to buy that book and the library is their only source of getting their hands on it, only to find that the book has been stripped away from the shelves just because a parent didnt want that book to even be in sight of their children. Like I stated before, if a parent does not want their children reading something intended for a mature audience or something that goes against their religion or race, then the parent should supervise what their child reads in anyway possible.",8070,8071.0,Honestly  take book  magazine  kind media shelf unless damaged much  disc scratched constantly freezes doesnt even get read scanner drive  time throw away  book torn andor cover missing  time throw away  My reason statement farely simple  I ll start fact taking away selection stuff away shelf  I know alot contraversy whether book series   CAPS ought sold publicly detail witchcraft wizardry  People said offensive religion  But books like popular number one sellers economy boosters get publicity library  Another reason parents dont want kids get book cursewords kind adult content within pages  Then parents ask employees thelibrary option age restrictions applied childs library card account keep viewing mature books  If thing simply tell child check book inaproppriate material  If parent trust child follow directions check child brings home library  If worried child viewing inaproppriate material library parent simply go library child  If parent make time go library children maybe time child use school s mediacenter go library  My point  others suffer reprocussions one child parent like option read  And honesty stupid something like  thats taking away freedom people read  Maybe person doesnt money buy book library source getting hands  find book stripped away shelves parent didnt want book even sight children  Like I stated  parent want children reading something intended mature audience something goes religion race  parent supervise child reads anyway possible 
5525,2,"I don't think that the books, movies, music, and the magizines should be tooken off the shelves. If they are remove that means that alot of the people in the wouldn't have somthing to read. They need to leave them books on the shelves so that the older people and the teens has some thing to read at the local libarys. And if the book or magazines are not really bad then they could let the unger kids read and look at the books. For the music they can leave it on the shelves also, so that people can listen to it when they want to. Because most of the songs that they listen to they have heard it be for. Alot of the movies are bad but we can just leave them on the shelves to, because the kids parents has let them see it or let them see another movie close to it. Now some of the really bad movies they can take them off the shelves because it give the little kids nightmares or it will be to scarey for them. They just need to leave all of the offensive things on the shelves. If the parents don't want there kid to look, listen, or read the offensive things they need to make sure that they don't. When they look, listen or read it they know what not to do because some times things are better to found out by your self and the hard way. When they get older they will see things like it with or with out there parents premision so why not let them find out by them selfs.

Have you ever walked into your local librarie and saw something that offened u or someone u know? Well a man in my nearby community saw an issue of sports illustrated in his communitys kids only librarie. He was so offened by this he had all the books gone through and searched for inapropiete matieral,do you belive this is right? Another case would be an overprotective parrent walking into a librarie armed with a protesting army to try and stop all things that are in her librarie other then childrens books.What would the other people in that community read if things like this happened?So I guess another question for you would be where should the local libraries draw the line on what they stock on thier library shelves? My personal belive is that the libraries of the world should be able to stock watever they feel is nessecary to help the childrena and the people of thier community get a better understainding of the world and everthing in it.I know most will disagree with this aproach but i belive thats what it will take to get my generation and the next generation of kids to be good readers and writers.Even though thier are certaine things children should't be exposed to such as some of the magazines libraries stock on thier shelves.Also in another way it helps them in a way by showing them other asspects of the world i know when i was younger i wish i could of read all the sporting magazines over winne the pooh or an issue of top gun over elmo.I gues what im trying to say is that kids should have the freedom to pick what they want to read not be forced to read something they dont like.I know if i would of bene able to read what i liked not what i was forced to read i would still be an avid reader seeing as now i read maybe a book a year and thats only if its manditory for me to read it. I also in a way am glad that my parents didnt let me read those because in a way the books i did read when i was younger shaped me to be who i am today.So in all honesty just spend time with your kids read with them play with them but most inportant never make it feel like they are forced to read something they dont want to as this will puch them away from reading anything at all. I guess what im trying to say is let your kids choose what they want to read but also watch over what they read.i know for a fact that no kid wants to be hounded to read a book by his mother so let him do other things also.So i hope you take the things i said into consideration and ethier ease off of the kids or strictren up some because it will help your kids in the future.So head on out to your local librarie and get a book and have some quality time with the family over a good book",8074,8075.0,The main purpose writing letter inform happening local librariesMy question think acceptable limit shownlistiened ur librarie  Have ever walked local librarie saw something offened u someone u know  Well man nearby community saw issue sports illustrated communitys kids librarie  He offened books gone searched inapropiete matieral  belive right  Another case would overprotective parrent walking librarie armed protesting army try stop things librarie childrens booksWhat would people community read things like happened  So I guess another question would local libraries draw line stock thier library shelves  My personal belive libraries world able stock watever feel nessecary help childrena people thier community get better understainding world everthing itI know disagree aproach belive thats take get generation next generation kids good readers writersEven though thier certaine things children shouldt exposed magazines libraries stock thier shelvesAlso another way helps way showing asspects world know younger wish could read sporting magazines winne pooh issue top gun elmoI gues im trying say kids freedom pick want read forced read something dont likeI know would bene able read liked forced read would still avid reader seeing read maybe book year thats manditory read  I also way glad parents didnt let read way books read younger shaped todaySo honesty spend time kids read play inportant never make feel like forced read something dont want puch away reading anything  I guess im trying say let kids choose want read also watch readi know fact kid wants hounded read book mother let things alsoSo hope take things said consideration ethier ease kids strictren help kids futureSo head local librarie get book quality time family good book

5528,2,"I believe that there shouldn't be censorship in libraries if some material is found offensive towards others. It is not fair to someone if a book is taken off a shelf because it is considered offensive. People read books to learn and gain more of a vast knowledge. People choose what they want to read, whether it pertain to being labeled as 'offensive' or whether it be an ordinary novel. If people start taking books off shelfs and keeping things a secret, then people will no longer have the opportunity to gain that knowledge they would have liked to. I would have to agree with what the author, Katherine Paterson, has stated. If someone has the right to remove an offensive book from a library shelf, then another has a right to remove what they think is an offensive book, thus leaving very seldom books left for people to read. Some people might believe that some of the content is offensive, and others think differently. It is the reader who chooses what he or she would like to read that day or learn about. I do agree that much of music is offensive, but people choose what they want to listen to. If somebody is having a bad day, music could be their spark to getting through. It isn't fair to take away someone's music. To some, music is their 'life.' They live by it day by day. With our technology, we have headphones and earbuds to prevent others to listening to that music. If somebody feels offended by any means, it is their choice rather to read that book, listen to that music, or watch that movie. It's not like they are being forced to do anything. Certain things that the offended person does could offend another. If people would start taking things away and keeping a censorship on them, libraries would have very little to nothing. So once again, I believe that there shouldn't be a censorship in libraries if the material come offending to others",8078,8079.0,I believe nt censorship libraries material found offensive towards others  It fair someone book taken shelf considered offensive  People read books learn gain vast knowledge  People choose want read  whether pertain labeled offensive  whether ordinary novel  If people start taking books shelfs keeping things secret  people longer opportunity gain knowledge would liked  I would agree author  Katherine Paterson  stated  If someone right remove offensive book library shelf  another right remove think offensive book  thus leaving seldom books left people read  Some people might believe content offensive  others think differently  It reader chooses would like read day learn  I agree much music offensive  people choose want listen  If somebody bad day  music could spark getting  It nt fair take away someone s music  To  music life   They live day day  With technology  headphones earbuds prevent others listening music  If somebody feels offended means  choice rather read book  listen music  watch movie  It s like forced anything  Certain things offended person could offend another  If people would start taking things away keeping censorship  libraries would little nothing  So  I believe nt censorship libraries material come offending others
5529,2,"We all go to libraries and see all kinds of different matearls each with different points of veiws, but now think we should removie any items from the selfs. Every thing in this world effects people differently, what one finds offensive might not offend anotther person. To me each book, magazine, movie, and song teaches us somthing. Every thing out there has a meaning. Somthing someone whats you to see, read, hear,or watch. Like books on black history or slavery, some take that very offensive but its good that we know what happend to human beings in the past because history repeats itself. There is this one song called 'words I never said' and in that song the singer trys to tell us that theres alot going on in this world that we do not know about. He makes one statement in his song that he thinks that all the silance is worst then all the voilance, and to me that is true. Now to a government person that song could be offensive because he talks about people of the government in that song but to me that song is good and it makes me think about what the government is hidding from us. Magazines often have pictures of women who are very skinny and have amzing bodys, and to some one who dose not they want to take that down. But in reality thats person dose not truly look that every thing is computerized and touched up now a days. In my opinion people over think and analzy things to much. now for little kids ir think that books and materals parents dont want there kids to see should be cut off. Everything that is published has a meaning to it and it is out there for us to find out what that meaing is so I dont not think that any thing should be taken off the selfs. but every one has there own belivef and opionio this is just mine and how I see things.

5530,2,"I believe that libraries should offer a variey of different material. Nothing should have to be removed from the shelves. How are people suppose to learn about the worlds history, or major events that have taken place if we do not have the resources to learn from? This world is no where near perfect and as a society we should all know that. Everybody is entitled to their own opinion, and we all have the right to say what we think is best. There are times that we have to put our pride aside, and do what we know is the right thing to do. It wouldn't be right to sensor important information from adolesents and children. They have the right to know and learn the truth. I believe every book has a special purpose and meaning. They are each written for a certain reason. We live in a free nation, which means nobody is forced to have to read something they don't want to read. Books have been around for thousands of years and are the major tools we use to learn from. They brought many of us joy as a child to be able to listen and explore the adventures that every story tells. Books are like humans because no two humans are the same, just as no two books are exactly the same, as well. Music has been around since the beginning of time. It's a way to express yourself and learn to listen to things in different ways. There are so many types of different kinds of music. Every person has different tastes in music, so a library should not exclude any certain kind. People use music for many different reasons. Peope use music to relax, teach, inform, express, as a hobby, etc. Every part of the world uses music, some countrys use it in ceremonies, religion, to pay respect, and to worship. A world without music is unimaginable! No library should ever have to remove a kind of music, just to create censorshop. Music can bring the world closer together in unity. Movies are a great sorce of entertainment. Movies help us learn a topic visually, which gives us a better explanation of topics and certain circumstances. Movies are used to teach, inform, educate, and bring us happiness. Movies have different kinds of rating that inform us on what age group the movie is appropriate for. A library shouldn't have to remove some movies just because of a certain topic or rating. The rating gives a clear explanation as to why the movie is rated or Parents and teachers are educated enough to be able to make the choice of rather they believe the movie is alright for that group of people or person to watch. A library shouldn't be forced to have to make that choice for them. Just like books, music, and movies; magazines are used for the purpose of entertainment, to inform, and to teach. There are a broad range of different types of magazines, as well. I believe libraries should offer every kind of magazine. Obvisoully not the kind that are created for adult eyes only; which are not appropriate for a public community library, at all! But as far as different styles of magazines that are made to be read for diffent genders or educate us on certian things, libraries should offer them. Based on my own experiances, if I'm needing to find certain information on a topic and a library doesn't carry any information about it, it drives me crazy! libraries are used by people as a convienance for them. No one wants to have to go through a lot of trouble to find what they're looking for. My observations while in a library is very broad. There are manys different types of ages, both male and females, families, friend, employees, teachers, etc. We all use the library for the same reason though. We all go there to find information on topics. And to find books, movies and music that we want for entertainment. Overall books, music, movies and magazines are all important to a community. Without them life wouldn't be the same. We need to offer every type of them, so no person is left out. They offer us so much knowledge on each generation of the world and the different types of cultures in it.

5531,2,"Would you what your childern reading inappropriate books? Well in most cases parents would want your child to read inappropiate books. Some books you have to have a creative imagation to read, and others books just say any and everything in them. That is why the library is sectioned off into an adult section, teen section, and a childern section, for this reason that childern would sneak into the adult section and take it back to the childern section to look at it. I agree with Author Katherine Paterson, because of the fact that childern will be looking around the adult section trying to look at look the '@CAPS2' books or Magazines or even take a rated movie. But in the same way as decrided, if we do take them off the shelves we will not have any book left for us to look at. But then again why we want to read those kind of books. I believew if that are for them what is it going to do us to read them. So to make a long story short, i would have a whole floor for adult books, music, magazines,and movies, and have an age limit to those who can or can not be on that floor at any time. Some library have taken books of the shelves for being rated by parents. But their are others ways to solve this problem. One is to make a whole floor for the library go to a adult floor.

The truth is that it has been taken off the shelf, for good. The book that you loved back in high school is now found offensive and anrchist. This is what is happing day after day books being taken of the shelfs because people are becoming over sencitised.

5535,2,"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found in some sort offensive. You wonder why. Well I believe that there are a few reasons and im going to bring to your attention a few of them. A few things in mind that maybe offensive be a minor that isn't being supervised can come across one of these books, or items named in the selection and change how he or she feels about somthing, theres also the fact that people get offended by what they see on the shelves and want to protest the shop or where ever the offending item had been spotted. I believe that having these things in reached of minors can be a life changing issue on younglings. Lets say for instance a young child has been living by his familys religion, and one day comes across a book or video or artical of some sort telling him or her false information and lies about his or her religion.

5536,2,"The idea of censorship in a library is utterly ridiculous. There is absolutely no way that anyone can know what the term 'offensive literature' means to the population as a whole. As the text everyone has their own concept of what obscenity is. The problem is that no two beings have that exact same belief. I can say confidently that most people would not want our children reading an adult sex novel. Even though I say that, it does not mean in any way that the genre shouldn't be available in order to keep children from aquiring them. I suggest that we confide within the definition of obscene material to regulate what should and should not be available. Which includes that the material not show an unwholesome intrest in sex and must have some sort of artistic value, among other things. Sexual material is not the only thing that is questioned when it comes to censoring libraries. Offensive language is also an issue. Offensive language constists of vulgarity, racism, sexism, and strikes againts sexual preference. Material with offensive laguage is also a very difficult thing to classify. Again, it comes down to the fact that no two people have the same definition of the term 'offensive literature'. I believe that the censorship of a library should be non existant.

If the issue is kids reading books that are inappropriate for them, then their parents should be the ones checking up on them, besides they are their responsibility. Older teens and adults should not be banned the right to check out the books that they want just because children are not being taken care of when looking for a good book.

Could you imagine if books that are said to be 'inappropriate' would be taken off the shelves? The would be half empty. Reallity check, its the real world and those are real books.

Valuable information that people go to libraries to find a lot of times is cut out because of censorship.

There could be foul language or not suited for person under years of age. My personal oppinion is that books should not be censored. If a book needs censored it should be stored away for children books and dictionaries. They should not be taken off the shelf for no one to read.

My dads an author and he doesn't do it for the money, he does it because he likes reading and writing and he wants to be heard.

5542,2,"We all know that certain books, authors, movies, and music are banned in public libraries. But, why? This is a question that is usually answered with one word. Kids. There is no age specification, just the one term. But, why must we be punished because a parent got a hold of what a child had checked out at the library under their supervision? The answer is, we shouldn't. What must a book, movie, or music album contain to have it taken off of the shelf? Everything is open to interpretation so there is no answer. Believe it or not, but a cuss word or a sex scene in any material offered in a library can add to a story in a good way. Just because we read about something doesn't mean we will do it in real life. I don't know about you, but I sure have not seen anyone sparkle like diamonds in the sun or try to ride a broom to some magic school in Yes, we're human and the things that we are concious of doing often scare and alarm us, but that doesn't mean that we should become ignorant because something or someone forces us to open our eyes a little wider. I do agree that there are things in literature and music that kids should not be introduced to yet. Isn't that what we have rating system for? Aren't the guidelines there for when you should be able to handle the content in which you are about to be exposed to? I believe that books should have warnings on them to make it clear who should not read or listen to the material. Not like our movie rating system though, it should be more like a 'suggested' rating. Reading shouldn't be ruined for those who are comfortable with ingesting the literature that others deam inappropriate for their age. If we create a warning system for books and then again notify the member of what they are about to check out, we wouldn't need to censor as many types of literature. We can't judge another's creation because of what we deam appropriate and inappropriate. Instead of disabling an unmotivated reader of consuming a story that will inspire their inner literate thinker,let us remind them of what they're about to read and then encourage the new reader with more books to satisfy them.

If kids read bad things and learned about them it could have a bad outcome on them. One way it could have a bad outcome on them is it could teach them bad things. The stories could teach the kids to do bad things to people or themselfs. The stories about drugs and doing illeagel things would have a negative outcome on them. It could teach them that doing drugs is ok or breaking the law. Also another way is that it could teach kids to treat people the wrong way. Like if the book is about someone being rude to people the kids migt think that is ok and tret people that way.

5544,2,"I have many opinions on the view of library censorship. I believe that censoring libraries would destroy them and also the learning enviroment in which they create. Alot of the information is not appropriate for all ages, however; if anyone desires to read that book, then they should be allowed to do so. What one see as bad, another see as useful. Censoring anything in a library is highly constructive. If I am years old and I have an anotomy project in class. My textbook does not always convey some of the necassary information that I wish to use. So if I find a more detailed book specifically on anatomy, then I can do my project to the extent that I wish. Even though anatomy books usually include nudity and detailed pictures of what can be construed as inpropriate, the message of the book is to teach and explain the anatomy of humans, it is not at all pornographic. Everyone in the world has a different view on different things. Where someone see a pornographic picture, someone see art, or another see that it is educational for the anatomy. It depends on the subject the book holds, and how the book portrays that information. I do believe that children should be able to obtain certain materials that society deems 'inapropriate' but is up to said individual if they are of a certain age. If I were a parent and my child brought a book to me that I thought would be too much, I would simply replace the book to its proper spot. What be bad for my child, be more appropriate to a teenager or a younger adult. Everyone deserves an equal chance to obtain the same knowledge as those before them. Some books be outlandish and bizzare, but we should'nt cast them away. Books are used as written logs from the past. They share an author's idea, through a story or through a collection of pictures and facts. Books are about sharing a story or history with everyone around them. They are not always appropriate for all ages, but as we grow older we can seek more and more into the world and discover things we never knew about. Just because there is a book enjoyed by a teenage high school student, that doesnt mean it will bring that same joy to a elementary student.

Censorship in libraries? Some ask why, is it hurting? They have never been censored before why start now? The reason is because more and more kids are getting into things they should not be at a younger age. This is due to the resources they are able to get to in libraries, at home, or even just advertisements. Libraries should be a place where parents can drop their kids off and not worry if they will be getting into trouble, or seeing and researching things they should not just because they have access to them.

5550,2,"I believe that everyone has their own right to their opinion. Some peolpe believe differntly than others. That is why is a great country because you have the right of what you believe in. Some people get mad about others beliefs, but that doesn't mean they should take them out of society. I believe their are mature things in libraries that parents don't want their children to read. Libraries then should have a section for these mature books. I also believe that some people that say others are beliefs are wrong should take a step ack and see how much they really know about the other persons religion and see how similar they could be. Some children are to protected by their parents that they never get the chance to make a decision. Children need to know that it is okay to have different beliefs and not discrimnate against some who believes differnetly. The one thing I hate is when I see a mother or father not letting a kid schoose what they want to read to some extent of course. Books can be very boring, I am and i still am bored of books, I like certain stuff and making someone read what they don't like makes them feel like they hate books. Now their are soem books that can be for mature audiences only and I don't have to tell you what they are. If a kid really wants to get his hands on it he will be able if in a library or not. Showing that its in a library maybe kids won't want it so bad. Kids seem to want stuff that they are not supposed to have. Everyone has got that feeling of having something without their parents knowing. So it doesn't matter where it is they will be able to get it. Library is for information, and their are some people that will tell you some moivies, music, and magazines don't give you that. I believe these people are wrong because you can learn a lot from these sources. Maybe their is an up and coming musician who doesn't have the money to get music so they go into the library to listen to it and they get a new idea. Maybe a someone gets an idea from a moivie or a magazine and that helps them figure out what they want to do with their life. You never know that one magazine, that one song, or that one moivie can change someones life. So to an extent I can see why libraries need censorship but you can always put a private section for things parents don't want kids to see. Maybe better placement of the books is what libraries should do so a parent doesn't get mad if they see somethiong that makes them blush. There will always be people that want evn more censorship in libraries but their are always people like that. You will always have people at one extreme like myself who says everyting can be somewhat informational and not to censor libraries at all, and the ones who wnat everything censored. They don't realise their is worst stuff on the televeison than in libraries and kids are getting smarter than adults with technology so if they want something they are supposed to have they will find a way to get it.

5551,2,"Censorship means, in my eyes, blocking or sheilding somone or a group of people from hearing, seeing and believing certain things. Censorship is all around the world. Some use it on their whole mass of people so they dont see western influences or anything of the sort, use it so students are seeing things they think is not right for a student in school to see, and parents use it, so their kids are rasied how they believe is right. I think censorship is fine to an extent not over doing it. I believe that just because one thing offends one person you should not have to block the masses from it. I have realized, in my short life, that the littlist things that seem miniscule and unimportant can offend somone to such an extent that they intend to do somthing about it. I understand keeping kids from fewing things that is not age appropriate, and you can try as hard as you want to sheild them but it will get through some how. I think going to extreams like removing good literature from not allowing music which I feel is a way of expression, and also movies, and magazines is out of the question. I have grown up hardly sheltered. Im not saying my mother told me about all these things kids shouldnt know about till they are older but i learned these things from school, walking through stores, and just being at home. You are exposed to everything and no matter how hard you try to hide it from somone it will get through. Understand i think keeping kids from fewing adult matters like sexual content and things along those lines is perfectly okay, untill they come of age where it should be reveiled to them. Just recently actually I had heard that they have stopped showing the cartoon '@CAPS3 and I dont know if you are familar with the childs show but i grew up on it, it is about a clever little mouse that tries to keep away from a cat and it is commical and fun. They have decided to stop showing this program during times where kids can few it for many little reasions some you might find crazy and unreasionable. I believe a few where, 'In some episodes it shows getting hit in the head and travling up to a big white gate with wings and a halo this pushes religion on people.' another i believe was stated some what like this 'In an episode dresses as a female to try to trick this shows femonism.' going to the extent of taking off the air a harmless childrens show, I think is rediculous. It was all done in fun and had been watched for many many years even before my time. I understand many good books have been banned from libararys like the and maybe even for whitch craft and wizardry, these books and shows i had grown up on and I find my self to be a good person that abides by the laws of my state and country and treats people with much respect. So i believe that censorship in and public places like that is okay to a certain point if it is over done, it cause harm rather than help.

5552,2,"Can you think of any books, magazines, movies, and magazines are just too vulger for young readers? There are a lot of movies out there that I would not want my children to see! Sometimes the language or graphics even distraunt me! I suggest that any movie that is worse than needs to be taken off the shelves. Bad language is one of the main things I hear and see. I hear it mostly in movies. I try not to watch too many movies that I know have bad language. I do not watch rated movies. You know that if you watch a rated movie that there is going to be terrible language in it, so why even rent it? Magazines can also be awful when it comes to pictures. Sometimes the advertisement in magazines is when the bad pictures come into play. Magazines like to advertise alcohol, cigrettes, and weight loss pills. If a child is looking at a magazine and they see an advertise for alcohol then they are likely to ask their parents what it is. Maybe that child's parents doesnt think that their child should know what it is. Also when the advertise things like cigarettes and alcohol they sometimes forget to include the bad risk that they come with. Weight loss pills are not good for you either. They can make you have a lot of heart problems. Some books for teenagers talk about anorexia. I do not think those books should be out on the shelves. I personally think that writers shouldn't even be able to publish them. Girls are more likely to read than boys and girl are also more likely to be anorexic than boys. If a teenage girl is reading a book and the character in the book is anorexic and she talks about how skinny she is then the reader is likely to think that it's okay to be anorexic. Usually in books they do talk about the negative things that come along with anorexia but I'm sure that someone could turn those positive things into good things and become anorexic. Do you agree at all? I hope so! Maybe if everyone would agree and maybe even start a petition then we could get all the vulger material off the shelves and stop all the bad language, pictures, and advertising of things that do not need to be advertised!",8126,8127.0,Can think books  magazines  movies  magazines vulger young readers  There lot movies I would want children see  Sometimes language graphics even distraunt  I suggest movie worse needs taken shelves  Bad language one main things I hear see  I hear mostly movies  I try watch many movies I know bad language  I watch rated movies  You know watch rated movie going terrible language  even rent  Magazines also awful comes pictures  Sometimes advertisement magazines bad pictures come play  Magazines like advertise alcohol  cigrettes  weight loss pills  If child looking magazine see advertise alcohol likely ask parents  Maybe child s parents doesnt think child know  Also advertise things like cigarettes alcohol sometimes forget include bad risk come  Weight loss pills good either  They make lot heart problems  Some books teenagers talk anorexia  I think books shelves  I personally think writers nt even able publish  Girls likely read boys girl also likely anorexic boys  If teenage girl reading book character book anorexic talks skinny reader likely think s okay anorexic  Usually books talk negative things come along anorexia I m sure someone could turn positive things good things become anorexic  Do agree  I hope  Maybe everyone would agree maybe even start petition could get vulger material shelves stop bad language  pictures  advertising things need advertised 
5553,2,"Creating a To people in todays society, offensive words and things that you read are hurtful. It can cause fights and hurt feelings towards one another. In order to prevent these hurtful actions from taking place we should allow censorship to occur in libraries around the country. Censorship in libraries would allow parents to feel more comfortable with what their children could possibly be reading when they are not around. Children have a tendancy to do what they see or read. So by using censorship you are taking away chances for children to act offensivly towards one another. It's always displeasing to walk into a library with hopes of finding a nice simple movie to watch or a good book to read and then see someting that is the complete opposite, and somewhat offensive. It causes a displeasing feeling to occur, and put you in a bad mood for the rest of your day. By getting rid of offensive books, movies, magazines, and music we are letting a more joyful and care free feeling to live in a community. In small towns the community knows one another very well, and if someone sees one of their friends reading something that is offensive towards them then they become angry with eachother. This can cause a lot of arguments in a community and keep them from being as close as they possibly could. By using censorship you are limiting the amount of places where someone could find something offensive to read. This could potentinally bring a community closer together and make them a strong closely bonded family rather than a small town in the middle of nowhere. By applying Censorship to our libraries, we are closing the door on offensive things said to one another, and are opening a new door for a close friend or a new Censorship can't change the world, but it can make it more welcoming towards those who aren't wanted",8128,8129.0,Creating To people todays society  offensive words things read hurtful  It cause fights hurt feelings towards one another  In order prevent hurtful actions taking place allow censorship occur libraries around country  Censorship libraries would allow parents feel comfortable children could possibly reading around  Children tendancy see read  So using censorship taking away chances children act offensivly towards one another  It s always displeasing walk library hopes finding nice simple movie watch good book read see someting complete opposite  somewhat offensive  It causes displeasing feeling occur  put bad mood rest day  By getting rid offensive books  movies  magazines  music letting joyful care free feeling live community  In small towns community knows one another well  someone sees one friends reading something offensive towards become angry eachother  This cause lot arguments community keep close possibly could  By using censorship limiting amount places someone could find something offensive read  This could potentinally bring community closer together make strong closely bonded family rather small town middle nowhere  By applying Censorship libraries  closing door offensive things said one another  opening new door close friend new Censorship ca nt change world  make welcoming towards nt wanted
5554,2,"Censorship: the removal and/or filtration of items in libraries because they might be offensive to whom they encounter. Is it right to remove items from a shelf just becouse they might be offensive to a select group of people? I say no. If somone is offended by a book, movie, or magazine, they can just stop reading or watching it if they are that badly offended. Almost all of the time, the title tells the reader exactly what it talk about, if not, the summery If the title or the summery include a topic that someone finds offensive, then they don't need to read it. Just because an item is offending to a small gorup of people, doesn't mean the item must be discontinued for everyone else. Some people might even like the item because of what it says that people take offence to. I once read a book and it had said a word that I deffinatly thought was offensive. I had not closed the book. It was only that word, throughout the entire book, that I had found offensive. I could have stopped reading then and there, but I didnt't, I read on and thet word didn't come up again. You see, to me that one word was and is offensive, but I still enjoyed that book and wanted to read it again. Another reason that censorship should not be allowed, is that if the library staff think the item is innapropriate or offensive, then the book should not need to be read for a class. If it is needed for a class, then they are forcing the book onto you. That is how it becomes an issue. If the item that could be offensive is forced onto students, then some of them take offence. I do think the quote is right; 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' (@PERSON1). But that does not mean that the book should be taken away form everyone. If it makes it better, then put an age limit on the book, so that no one of a certain age can take that item off the shelf. If censorship were to continue '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (@PERSON1). This just means that in some way every item in a library is going to be offensive to some people, so if censorship continues, all the items in a library be gone. I understand that I have stated the reasons mostly concerning books, but these can all apply to all the medias: books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Censorship is not right and should not be put into action in any library.",8130,8131.0,Censorship  removal andor filtration items libraries might offensive encounter  Is right remove items shelf becouse might offensive select group people  I say  If somone offended book  movie  magazine  stop reading watching badly offended  Almost time  title tells reader exactly talk   summery If title summery include topic someone finds offensive  nt need read  Just item offending small gorup people  nt mean item must discontinued everyone else  Some people might even like item says people take offence  I read book said word I deffinatly thought offensive  I closed book  It word  throughout entire book  I found offensive  I could stopped reading  I didntt  I read thet word nt come  You see  one word offensive  I still enjoyed book wanted read  Another reason censorship allowed  library staff think item innapropriate offensive  book need read class  If needed class  forcing book onto  That becomes issue  If item could offensive forced onto students  take offence  I think quote right  All us think book hope none children children taken shelf    PERSON   But mean book taken away form everyone  If makes better  put age limit book  one certain age take item shelf  If censorship continue   books left shelf us    PERSON   This means way every item library going offensive people  censorship continues  items library gone  I understand I stated reasons mostly concerning books  apply medias  books  music  movies  magazines  etc  Censorship right put action library 
5555,2,"In today's modern world, censorship sparks controversy from many library patrons and citizens. Many individuals have different viewpoints about this controversial topic, and often these values contradict the beliefs of their peers. Censorship refers to the elimination of materials deemed offensive and harmful to prelude any disruptive activity that can harm the world. In this particular situtation, I believe that certain materials in libraries such as books, music, movies, and magazines should not be censored, although many individuals interpret as offensive. An example of censorship in today's society is filters and its effect on the library and its surrounding environment. Many people feel that filters serve a vital function in order to censor material on the that can be harmful and disruptive to people of all ages. Libraries are places patrons go to learn to information, and gather knowledge to help them with their everyday lives. Libraries today provide a wide array of novels to protect the human rights. Another example of censorship is shown in novel. As I interpreted from the novel, the topic of censorship appealed to the individuals of that time and age, and they strongly believed that books should be censored because they serve no apparent function in society. Many felt that books are useless, tedious, and prevent them from enjoying other activities they adore. A scene from the book is when a elderly lady stood up for her beliefs and values, and died just to keep the fireman from burning her books and her house. However, reading books and understanding its context is not only beneficial to the well-being and character of individuals, but it also teaches life lessons that will aid them in the future. I strongly believe that censorship in libraries is not only unjust, but it keeps people from understanding the complexity of information found in novels and its strong impact it can have on those who read them. Each book in a library is unique in its own way. They contain content that be humorous, mysterious, interesting, or even suspenseful. That's what makes books the way they are. Although some books be offensive to one person, they shouldnt be removed from shelves because another person might enjoy the same exact book. I do believe that certain books should be edited or censored so that it wont have a harmful influence on children and young adults, however I feel that if someone has a certain issue with a book on the shelf, they can leave the library and go somwhere else. According to the each citizen in is entitled to freedom of speech, and human rights. There are a diverse number of people in today's society, and that is what makes our world interesting and creative. Each individual is personally responsible for the actions that they perform. In other words, if a certain material in a library is deemed as offensive to people, they have a right to complain but they dont have the right to eradicate it from shelves. I do believe that some material found in novels are astonishing and makes me uncomfortable. But if one person feels that a book is offensive, their are many other individuals who believe that the book is interesting and pleasant. Would it be fair to eliminate a book just because a person doesnt like it? The answer is simple. No. For example, when I went to the library a couple days ago, I picked up a book and right then I loved it. When I went to check it out, I saw another girl pick up the same book, read a portion of it, and set it back down. She seemed to dislike it. Just because the girl doesnt like it, doesnt mean that the book should be removed. Like I said before, libraries are places people go to interact with their peers, and learn new life lessons. If certain material was censored, no one would enter libraries because all the material has been diminished and removed. Each individual has a fundamental mind of their own which sets them apart from those around them. They each enjoy different books, and they each learn new ideas. Censoring books that be offensive should not be permitted. Not only does this hurt the library and its state of mind, but it keeps people from reading what they like. As Katherine Paterson stated in her quote, certain books should be censored that be deemed harmful for children. However, then we wont have any books that people will read, and less people will visit libraries. Libraries should contain a variety of books and magazines, in order to attract more patrons and keep them open to new information",8132,8133.0,In today s modern world  censorship sparks controversy many library patrons citizens  Many individuals different viewpoints controversial topic  often values contradict beliefs peers  Censorship refers elimination materials deemed offensive harmful prelude disruptive activity harm world  In particular situtation  I believe certain materials libraries books  music  movies  magazines censored  although many individuals interpret offensive  An example censorship today s society filters effect library surrounding environment  Many people feel filters serve vital function order censor material harmful disruptive people ages  Libraries places patrons go learn information  gather knowledge help everyday lives  Libraries today provide wide array novels protect human rights  Another example censorship shown novel  As I interpreted novel  topic censorship appealed individuals time age  strongly believed books censored serve apparent function society  Many felt books useless  tedious  prevent enjoying activities adore  A scene book elderly lady stood beliefs values  died keep fireman burning books house  However  reading books understanding context beneficial wellbeing character individuals  also teaches life lessons aid future  I strongly believe censorship libraries unjust  keeps people understanding complexity information found novels strong impact read  Each book library unique way  They contain content humorous  mysterious  interesting  even suspenseful  That s makes books way  Although books offensive one person  shouldnt removed shelves another person might enjoy exact book  I believe certain books edited censored wont harmful influence children young adults  however I feel someone certain issue book shelf  leave library go somwhere else  According citizen entitled freedom speech  human rights  There diverse number people today s society  makes world interesting creative  Each individual personally responsible actions perform  In words  certain material library deemed offensive people  right complain dont right eradicate shelves  I believe material found novels astonishing makes uncomfortable  But one person feels book offensive  many individuals believe book interesting pleasant  Would fair eliminate book person doesnt like  The answer simple  No  For example  I went library couple days ago  I picked book right I loved  When I went check  I saw another girl pick book  read portion  set back  She seemed dislike  Just girl doesnt like  doesnt mean book removed  Like I said  libraries places people go interact peers  learn new life lessons  If certain material censored  one would enter libraries material diminished removed  Each individual fundamental mind sets apart around  They enjoy different books  learn new ideas  Censoring books offensive permitted  Not hurt library state mind  keeps people reading like  As Katherine Paterson stated quote  certain books censored deemed harmful children  However  wont books people read  less people visit libraries  Libraries contain variety books magazines  order attract patrons keep open new information

5557,2,"Do I think we should remove books or music from libraries if they are found offensive. I do not think we should because, just because one person finds it offensive does not mean the whole world does. One reason i think we should not take books away is it might take away from the meaning of the story or song. That people find it offensive. If someone takes it off it might offend more people just by banning it rather then leaving it on the shelf. For example many people were offended when the classic book was found offensive for the word useage of nigger. It won an and it was still tooken off the shelfs. Second reason is that people might not be read by some people if some people find it offensive. That is taking away a good story that alot of people will like to read. When i wanted to read a book that my parents like to read I couldn't because some people found it offensive. They told me what it was about and I really wanted to read it but i was never able to. That was five years ago and I still want to read it now but I can never find the book. Third reason it that if some people find it offensive then do not read it no one is forceing you to read the book or listen to the song. People sometimes over react to some books or songs if they find it offensive then do not read or listen to it. It is only ever tooken off the shelfs in libraries is because people over react and demand it be taken off the shelfs so their kids cannot read it. I say if you do not want your children to read it then tell their school that you do not want them to read it all. That is why I think that no books or songs should be censored or taken off the shelfs. One it will take away the meaning of the song or book.

5559,2,"I strongly disagree with censorship in libraries. So now why do I believe that it is bad? There are many reason behind why I do not agree with censorship. I believe that if it was a book that was made for an intended audience then that should be allowed to stay in the library specifically for that intended audience. Many books have things in them that could be offensive to people even if the author did not intend for it to be offensive. Everyone reads books differently and views books at many differnt perspectives. Some people might find it offensive while others find that it was interesting or for some it could change the way they look at life in extreme events. Censorship can be good in certain rare circumstances but at another view point its the peoples choice to read the book. If they find it offensive then they can put it down and go read another book. As I stated above in this article it only offend one or two people since every one views a book at there own view. It is a public place where people should be able to read what they want and have that freedom to. Censorship to magazines is outrageous because of the fact that the journalists are giving there opinion on a subject. They are not saying they are right or wrong on a subject but are just giving there opinion on a subject. So these should be out of censorship ruling because they are simply stated opinions and anybody has the right to disagree with them. Censorship to music and movies should be limited if not any at all. Since we have the freedom to be able to choose what we want to listen to, I do not believe there should be limitations other then what they have been rated. People should be allowed to listen or watch what they want because everyone takes music and movies in a differnt way as well. So some think that censorship is good. I find it to be an outright abomination and that it should not be allowed in a public library. As the name states they are public and people portray literature in many differnt aspects, some find it to be good while others view it as bad. So they should not remove things from the shelves based on some peoples opinions of it being bad because others might view it as being restricted to some one elses reading style.",8140,8141.0,I strongly disagree censorship libraries  So I believe bad  There many reason behind I agree censorship  I believe book made intended audience allowed stay library specifically intended audience  Many books things could offensive people even author intend offensive  Everyone reads books differently views books many differnt perspectives  Some people might find offensive others find interesting could change way look life extreme events  Censorship good certain rare circumstances another view point peoples choice read book  If find offensive put go read another book  As I stated article offend one two people since every one views book view  It public place people able read want freedom  Censorship magazines outrageous fact journalists giving opinion subject  They saying right wrong subject giving opinion subject  So censorship ruling simply stated opinions anybody right disagree  Censorship music movies limited  Since freedom able choose want listen  I believe limitations rated  People allowed listen watch want everyone takes music movies differnt way well  So think censorship good  I find outright abomination allowed public library  As name states public people portray literature many differnt aspects  find good others view bad  So remove things shelves based peoples opinions bad others might view restricted one elses reading style

5561,2,"Libraries are everywhere for people of all ages to use. Sometimes certain materials in such libraries not be age appropriate. Some parents not want their children to read about fighting, or read books with offensive material in them. In ones opinion, these books should be removed from the library, or placed into a library that are for adults. Children not know what type of book they are getting in an ordinary library. The book the child chooses could have profanity, or material their parents do not want them to read. These types of books should not be allowed in a childrens' library. When one goes into a library and selects a book off of a shelf, one not know the contents the book holds. For instance, if a child goes to a library looking for a book about a zoo, they see an animal on the front cover, and automatically think it is about a zoo. In reality that book most likely is not about a zoo. It could be about a hunt for that particular animal on the cover. Some children do not want to read a book about an animal being killed. Other times a teen could go to a library searching for a magazine, and end up getting one that is not age appropriate. When this happens a teen could find out information their parent does not want them to know. The parent become very angry with the librian for letting his/her child check out this magazine. Some libraries also lose customers for having those types of books, or magazines. In conclusion, one does not think it would be appropriate to have books, magazines, movies, etc., on their shelves if they are found offensive. Some parents would not want their child to learn some of the material found from a book, or magazine. So if ones child get something from a library, and is found offensive, the librarian should look over the material. Then they should see if it is appropriate or not. If it is not appropriate, it should not be in a library where little kids could start reading it",8144,8145.0,Libraries everywhere people ages use  Sometimes certain materials libraries age appropriate  Some parents want children read fighting  read books offensive material  In ones opinion  books removed library  placed library adults  Children know type book getting ordinary library  The book child chooses could profanity  material parents want read  These types books allowed childrens  library  When one goes library selects book shelf  one know contents book holds  For instance  child goes library looking book zoo  see animal front cover  automatically think zoo  In reality book likely zoo  It could hunt particular animal cover  Some children want read book animal killed  Other times teen could go library searching magazine  end getting one age appropriate  When happens teen could find information parent want know  The parent become angry librian letting hisher child check magazine  Some libraries also lose customers types books  magazines  In conclusion  one think would appropriate books  magazines  movies  etc  shelves found offensive  Some parents would want child learn material found book  magazine  So ones child get something library  found offensive  librarian look material  Then see appropriate  If appropriate  library little kids could start reading

5566,2,"Do libraries really need to be censored? Should the library tell you what you can or can't read? libraries shouldn't be censored. Libraries are where kids go and read what they are interested in. I think libraries shouldn't be censored for many reasons. Elementary school libraries should be censored because, the kids in the school are underage. They are probably only about years of age. Their parents won't want their kids reading books that have bad words in them. Elementary libraries should still be censored. If the library wasn't censored, then the kids would be very offensive to the other kids and teachers. The kids would then learn offensive words and sayings by reading uncensored books. Therefore, elementary schools should still stay censored. libraries shouldn't be censored because, the kids are already used to offensive language from their freind's or family members. There is no way to stop it, the school boards should just uncensor their libraries and put rules in place saying that they won't be able to cuss still. Reading books are good learning for a student. Libraries shouldn't say what you can or can't read because of the language. Libraries should have books that have offensive things to say because that is what the student likes to read. When a student goes to a library they go through books and see which one they like the most, so if there is a book that is offensive to the student they don't have to get it, they can just ignore it. students don't really care if the books are offensive or not most of them won't say anything about it to hurt someone else. If they don't like the book they can just check-out something else that interest them the most. The library can have a stand behind it to if they care or don't care about censored books. The students should have a choice of what they want to read. Libraries shouldn't force you to read offensive books or not. Elementary schools should stay uncensored so the kids won't be offensive to the other students or teachers. Many students have parents or friend's that talk offensive already.

5569,2,"As i read this i come to strongly disagree with what its says. I believe that just because you dont like some thing or get offended by it that it should be taken off shelves or removed period. You not like what thaht person is saying but you have to think about the other people that want to read or listen to that same thing. Also what ever it is thaht offended you is not directrly to you. It come from personal expeiences in life and the story some how relates to you in a way. Once again that doesnt mean it is for you. I had read a book abut teen moms and got very offened by it because i am a teen mom myself. Even though what the author was saying had gotten me upset i didnt stop reading the book or go back to the store that i had gotten it from and telll them to take it off shelves because i daint like what it was saying. I thought about what they where sayin and then thought about the other people that would come to love this very same book. In other words it really doesnt matter wgat you dont like or what offends you in any kind of way. That same thing you come to hate just might help somebody in the long run. Most people now days just dont understand that thing are mostly for entertainment. These authors and producers ect., dont mean to offend you in any kind of way. Some things you just have to leran to let go and not care about things that are said, seen ond or done. People in general act as if everything that comes out is about you. When you and everbody else around knows that it is not. On the other hand you shouldnt get offended about everything so fast or easy. I think that the books that offend people should be stamped or have something that says maybe offensive to sme peple in a kind way. That way many people would stop trying to take these important thing away from people that really could use it at that period of time. If that does not work then they should just leave what ever it is alone and give sombody else the chance to do what ever with it. Just because one person doesnt like it doesnt mean that you just take it away from othres. This sometimes hurt many people in the end.

5570,2,"Censorship is a sensitive topic that is associated with intolerance and a lack of respect. Many would like to ignore this issue. it is something that affects many countries and many people, and therefore deserves to be discussed at the length required. The main issue with censorship is, as Katherine Paterson says, the question of where to stop. The line between too much and too little is incredibly fine and easily corrupted. We can all agree that it would be inappropriate to let a young child watch a movie with sexual content. Restricting access to movies or books of a pornographic nature is a 'no-brainer'. , the division of good and bad for kids is blurred when it comes to violence, humor, and romance. It is hard to define a limit when different kids are brought up with different parents, who have different opinions. Some parents might consider the romantic and often sexual relationships of the popular book '@CAPS2' to be outrageously inappropriate for the age group it attracts. Others might think it harmless. This fuzziness complicates the matter until any one decision is always going to upset a sizeable amount of people. The major problem with censorship is that it often favors one group of people over another. In some schools in children are not taught the theory of evolution. This is due to the religious beliefs of the adults involved in the education system. By not teaching those children something that is fundamentally neccessary to understand more advanced sciences, the school is putting them at a disadvantage. A couple schools have gone as far as to remove books about evolution from school libraries. This is where the problem with censorship becomes evident. It is one thing to censor something based on what an individual thinks is appropriate for children. It is another thing to censor something based on one's own personal beliefs. This issue is especially important in where we have so many different groups of people, with variations of religion, race, and lifestyles. In order to coexist with one another, there is a certain level of respect that must be apparant between those groups. This level of respect is missing when one group completely removes the presence of another group. The most common occurance of this in is when groups attempt to ban certain books or movies based on a percieved offense to their own religion. The series '@CAPS4 was banned in many households because of the fictional witches and wizards, who are inconsistent with the faith. In the same way, books about other religions are often banned simply because they examine another perspective. This kind of censorship is blatantly wrong, and yet unfortunately still happens. One way to look at the issue of censorship is to change your own perspective. If the one being censored was you, would you think it was right? This question is not being asked enough in some places in the world, including right here in our country. Many children are refused the right to examine all the unique views of the world, and I believe it is restricting our ability to think and feel.",8162,8163.0,Censorship sensitive topic associated intolerance lack respect  Many would like ignore issue  something affects many countries many people  therefore deserves discussed length required  The main issue censorship  Katherine Paterson says  question stop  The line much little incredibly fine easily corrupted  We agree would inappropriate let young child watch movie sexual content  Restricting access movies books pornographic nature nobrainer    division good bad kids blurred comes violence  humor  romance  It hard define limit different kids brought different parents  different opinions  Some parents might consider romantic often sexual relationships popular book   CAPS  outrageously inappropriate age group attracts  Others might think harmless  This fuzziness complicates matter one decision always going upset sizeable amount people  The major problem censorship often favors one group people another  In schools children taught theory evolution  This due religious beliefs adults involved education system  By teaching children something fundamentally neccessary understand advanced sciences  school putting disadvantage  A couple schools gone far remove books evolution school libraries  This problem censorship becomes evident  It one thing censor something based individual thinks appropriate children  It another thing censor something based one s personal beliefs  This issue especially important many different groups people  variations religion  race  lifestyles  In order coexist one another  certain level respect must apparant groups  This level respect missing one group completely removes presence another group  The common occurance groups attempt ban certain books movies based percieved offense religion  The series   CAPS banned many households fictional witches wizards  inconsistent faith  In way  books religions often banned simply examine another perspective  This kind censorship blatantly wrong  yet unfortunately still happens  One way look issue censorship change perspective  If one censored  would think right  This question asked enough places world  including right country  Many children refused right examine unique views world  I believe restricting ability think feel

There are millions of people in our country, and if every person decided to take one show or one movie off the air there would be no entertainment for us. The media in magazines and books also influence the culture of Without this media our society would have no clue what to do. Certain materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries even if they are offensive to some people. We have the choice to watch a movie, read a book, or listen to a song, we have the authority to turn of these forms of media if they are offensive to us, and what we find offensive might appeal to others with different backgrounds or values. Born we are given many freedoms. Along with these freedoms include the right to view media we choose. Nitpickers can find anything wrong with a simple news broadcast or a funny show off commedy central. Without these forms of entainment we would not be informed without the news and we would not be entertained without television shows, such as those on commedy central. Throughout our lives we are proposed with great authority, especially as you grow up. We learn how to fin for ourselves; and I think, if you are able to prove yourself responsible enough to, for instance, drive a car, you should be able to watch, listen, or read whatever you would like. If you view something offensive you can simply turn it off. Others might view what you have just found offensive in a different way because we all have different outlooks. As for children, parents have the authority to prevent them from viewing offensive materials. Even some disney movies be found offensive to some people because of the hidden messages in them but until children are old enough to understand these meanings they will not be exposed to the offensive material, thus, I believe they should still be aired. If one ethnicity or religion finds some material offensive they can simply avoid it. For example, not everyone believes in but the bible is still published and sold in many stores or libraries; if people wish not to view the bible, they simple do not buy or open it. To others, the bible is sacred. In a world with so many different beliefs, values, and religions you cannot satisfy everyonoe by removing offensive materials from shelves of libraries. This would pose a huge problem considering their are so many different views out there. In conclusion, offensive materials should not be removed from shelves of libraries because as we have the choice to watch a movie, read a book, or listen to a song, we have the authority to turn off these forms of media if they are offensive to us, and what we find offensive might appeal to others. The right to view materials even if foundoffensive to others should be your choice and no one else's.

5573,2,"Dear Books are published for more than one reason, and although the readers not know what the reasonings are for the book being published, the author of the book does. In a library, there are countless books with countless generes to chose from. A girl chose a book about sexuality, and the boy chose a book about a train. Which ever way this person chooses to is their decision. Books are not written to make others feel uncomfortable, they are written to make a point. Learning the more provocative, cruel, and gory things about life before an individual turns is not always a bad thing. If a young girl reads a book, watches a movie, or reads a magazine and these things have scary scenes, along with some other 'questionable' things, couldn't one assume that the girl is only learning? Not only will she see what happens in real life, outside of her small town, but the woman will know what to look for when she is alone at night, and she hears a door open, or if some man she does not know is following her. Movies about murder and kidnappings always get the attention of young women, and although it sometimes scares girls, it also teaches them the dangers of other people. It is a lesson that lasts a life time. Perhaps some parents do not appreciate their children learning that way, but that is in their own hands. If a child and a parent agree that the child should not be reading or watching movies of that nature, then that is soley between the parent and child. The library bookshelves and movie ticket booths are not responsible for the child being disobedient and taking that book or watching that movie. It teach the child a valuable lesson, but at the same time, it might not. Nobody knows exactly what a person will take out of a lesson. Anything can be churned in the human brain, and made into something completly different than what it was intended for. In life, a lot of things unoticed, but then again, a lot of things do not. I have seen more than one scary movie, and read more than one book to scar me for life. I would say that I learned from these things. A book I once read was titled '@CAPS4 a diary kept by a young woman who remains anonomous throughout the novel, it is a book that shows the long winding road of her drug addiction. The book was published by her parents shortly after they came home from a movie one night, and found her dead, overdosed, on their living room floor. She was naive about the drug world before she got laced with at a party her good friend invited her to attend. After that day, she could not bare to without. As she tries to stop, her body forces her even more. It is something I will always keep in the back of my mind. A percaution, if you will. People are going crazy, off the walls, and doing things that they should not. I cannot say that I am one of those people. I know when to say, 'no', and I know when I am about to cross the line, and in that second, I stop what I am doing. I have learned these things from movies, books, and even some other people have taught me the ways of life. With that being said, I do not believe that books should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive, because sometimes the world comes across people such as myself. The people that learn more from these 'offensive' books than from the high school heath course.

If a reads a book about he/she think its offensive and wrong, it is also vice-versa. But it doesn't mean that the is going to try to refuse anybody else to read the book. If more people read the book then there are more opinions. If you took the book off just that one shelf, doesn't mean that it just magically disappears off all the other shelfs around the world. If you really wanted to do something about the book, you would have to do a lot of work and convince a large amout of people it's the right thing to do. Also if other people have read the book and think it's interesting and informative, why should they help? When you take that book off the shelf is it really solving anything?

5576,2,"Censorship, and the lengths of such, has been a heavily debated topic for years. Nowadays, we have cd's with '@CAPS1 stickers, warning adults of the proclaimed 'damage' the material might have on a young, unbiased mind. Let's take it back to the days when you weren't afraid to let your child walk down to the grocery store. Those lovely days when, 'I episodes showed and sleeping in completely seperate beds. Back then, there wasn't as much to worry about right? So why bring back that kind of censorship? I'll tell you why bringing back strict censorship or even taking risque materials off the shelf is a good idea. In today's society, one might argue that our youth are being brought up in 'gross' environments. Our youth are exposed to many vulgar ideals, and concepts each day. Yet, if you had the chance to homeschool your child, monitor their television exploits, and restrict them from ever entering into the without supervision, how prepared would your child be for the shocking and ever roaming of vulgarity and backlash that we all know is out there? Everyone knows that really religious family where their kids are angels, and where the is the most inspiring classic of all time. But, let's also take a closer look... I hope you realize that when those children are set free into the they are going to be so overwhelmed with the concept that, people don't do the right thing, on purpose! This could transpire into The young adult, or adolescent will be so compelled by their newfound freedom of choosing from right and wrong for themselves that they choose the wrong choice just to see what effect it will have! Think about it, if your entire life has been choosing to do the correct thing, for yourselves but because your parents never gave you the chance to choose wrong, what would you do? Would you be curious as to what the wrong choice could do? And furthermore, if you always chose to do the correct thing, and got a positive response out of it, would you realize that choosing to do the wrong thing could give you a negative The child - initially realizing how many indecent people there are in the could be very easily swayed, and very easily manipulated. This holds true to many scenarios, especially concerning drug and alcohol use. The childs easy ability to trust people could very well lead to an incident where they will probably trust the wrong people. Leading them further and further down the rabit hole and away from the morals that they were raised, and were comfortable with.@NUM1. The adoloscent's revelation into the wrong deeds of the could have effects of shock, disbelief, and dissappointment. What once these children thought was genuine, kind, and beautiful, and probably will turn out to be, generic, unthoughtful, and transpire from the wrong motives. Would this upset the young adult? Would this confuse them and cause them to lose some faith in man? Yes. Now, back to the issue. I believe, that if you were walking through walmart and just so happened to gaze down the shampoo isle, and suddenly! Your eyes are caught on a book to which the title is a curse word in big bold letters... You have every right to feel like you were unwantingly exposed to something that didn't really need to happen. It isn't right to reject the new and blasphemous ideals of the new masses, however it is right to say that, everyone should HAVE to see it. However, places such as stores, and other places of that nature, should be allowed for those specific civilians that would seek it out. In terms of reading material as well, having a section blocked off in the store for explicit material should also be taken into consideration. It isn't fair to warn the buyer of what they might be running into at the local bookstore. So read up buttercup! Listen to your music! Watch your sci-fi television series, because, with as much violence that leaks out of it, also rise to your ability to grow stronger as a person. To choose what is right and what is wrong for yourself. To create and build yourself up into whatever you want to be. It might just be the straw that breaks your back but, you know, if the straw never broke your back, you'd never fall down to recieve that time of rest.

You should also notify the librarian that you find it offensive. Most of all if you find it offensive, do not rent it. I personally do not find things in the library offensive; however, you might.

5578,2,"I believe that censoring certain things would not be wise a thing to do. My reasonings behind this are such, that it is impossible to censor life so why attempt to do the imposssible. My second reasoning is that it is the duty and responsibility of the parent and or legal gaurdian of a child to choose what they should and should not read, listen to, or watch, not the public library and or people's. My final reason is that it is no one's right to take away the rights to allow someone to listen to something or watch something, it is their given right and their constitutional right to choose what they want and have it their way. The first reasoning behind not wanting to censor cultural items, such as books, music, movies,ect. is that censoring life is unreasonable and impossible and all of these items are apart of everyday life. Books and movies have always dabbled on the edge of risque. They have always expressed topics or ideas too outlandish and unreformed to certain individuals, but these pieces of visual and literary imagery are parts of our culture. These items express the very individuality and rebelious nature our fine nation was founded upon. I recall various sitiuations inwhich movies and music have been edited of tweeked to make it so someone will not be offended. This tweeking and changing does not assist in the bringing about of a new and frontier world it merely puts the old and free and expressive world in the dark. By taking out the ideas and items seen as 'controversial' you take away greatly from the learning factor for various individuals, you strip them of some of the key items that lead to a successful and avid learning experience. One instance I can think of that is completly outlandish is individuals attempting to take 'under from the of The very thought of censoring from our nation's is an insult to the founders and all they stood for. My second reason is that personal censorship for children is the responsibility and duty of the parent or legal gaurdian.So many times has censorship,for youth, fallen upon the shoulders of the everyday individual when infact it is not their issue to deal with. It is the parent's job to let their child know what would be acceptable and unacceptable for them to view, read, or listen to. Now adays there are numerous songs,movies,and books that can be construde as 'outlandish', but it is not the responsibility of the everyday person to have to take the very things that they enjoy out of their lives because certain types of culture are unsettling to individuals,such as children. If such items are so awful for adolescents to hear or be exposed to parents should not allow them to be around it. They should have tighter control over what their sons or daughters are being exposed to if they belive such things can be harmful to their children's up bringing. My third, and final reasoning, is that whose right is it to take away another person's wants or certain things they enjoy. This country was founded upon a speficic set of guidelines allowing various things to be spoken,written, and showed. It would be an insult to the and the wishes for some individual to come in and take another persons rights away as though they are somehow better than they are. The documents this fine nation were founded on state that every man is created equal, that no one man has any leway over another. The set down these specific guidelines to ensure that no one would be higher in opinion or controlling strength than another. They did this to ensure the nation as a whole would ultimately prevail despite opposite opinions and opposing thoughts. I personally do not believe in censorship because it would tear apart this country's very foundations,and when you do tear a fine house's foundation the supporting beams and the rest of the house will follow. What I mean is that by crumpling the ideal that this country's states would ultimatly lead to a host of other issues that would have people wanting other things changed and more change and change begetts change and more change and very soon we would look at this country and not be able to recognize the face that we saw. In conclusion, I believe we should not censor the content in movies, music, or literature. My reasonings behind this are censoring life is unreasonable and impossible, it is the parent's of legal gaurdian's job to choose what their children are and arent exposed to, and itis no ones right to take other peoples wants from them.

I think that those books should be avaible to anyone that would like to read them as long as the books don't fall into the wrong hands. These types of books and material should be kept out of reach for kids and teens. This type of material is meant for adults a should not be read by the youth. In my opinion, I think that these books should be kept in the back were adults can still access them. If they are kept in the back then an adult would have to ask to get a hold of these books and material. I think that this material is also the public's opinion, whether they what this material out on shelves for everyone or if it should not be exposed. If it happened to be the public's opinion, it would be a good idea because they are the ones accessing this material. I think that if it was in the public's opinion that they would vote to have offensive material in the back so they can use it. I wouldn't be fair for the adults who are old enough for this material to not be able to access to it. When I was in the eight grade I was a library helper and the offensive and sexual material was on a shelf behind the counter. I think that is the right thing to do to keep it for getting in the wrong hands. I have been to libraries were they keep that stuff behind the counter and some were it is left out for everyone. I went to a book store once and they had all kinds of books every think from nuts to bolts and there was a couple sections of books that were sexual and offensive material that were for sale. Not all libraries keep that material away from the youth. It's hard to keep the youth from hearing and getting a hold of this information. The internet is the most accessed by them because almost every house hold has it. The internet is so advanced now that you can find anything your looking for.

5587,2,"Ew... I can't believe they would.... Why would this be in our library? It seems that sometimes you find books that could be offensive in some ways, or gross you out. But I think that people shouldn't freak out about it or try to remove them from public libraries. I think we should just be more laid back, and not be so upset about these things. In just about any library I'm sure you can find a book that might have inappropriate material in it. Whether it be language, adult situations, etc. But is there a reason why its such a big deal? I think we should be more comfortable with these things in order prevent conflict over a book in a library. It seems to me that the is the only place where we make such a big deal about material that could be seen as offensive. In they are really laid back about this kind of stuff, especially nudity.

While I was in we stopped at a gas station to fill up, I didn't notice until we pulled in that the gas station was connected to dirty magazine shop. I looked at the people around getting gas and no one seemed to care about it. But thats because they are comfortable with it, and it doesn't offend them. In theres not a chance you would see a regular person stopping at that gas station. Because we are so easily offended and everything has to be a big deal.

5589,2,"Should books, music,, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from the shelves of our libraries based on their content? This is one of the big questions in corporate today as so many people are vocal of their opinions. With new laws and justifications in today's society concerning censorship and equal rights for all, should we the people have the right to remove inappropriate content that fills our libraries? One of the biggest problems people face today is profanity. With foul language haunting everyday conversation as its home, many people face the challenge of dealing with it to get the material they need or removing it from their lives completely. Others feel that alittle profanity is okay and a part of life, but should not exceed a border line set by certain individuals. With these contraditions of opinions, much of the material in libraries today would be removed and valueable knowledge would be lost. Many great historic figures used profanity (particularly in war-times) to spark moral and encouragement, with these quotes in our texts how can we remove them from our lives when these words contributed to shaping the world we live in today. Another indulgence that has become somewhat of an obsession in everyday lives is sexual immorality. Many adult reads and some teenage works involve sexual situations and dialogue. With more disagreements between opinionators, some would remove these writings as they're inappropriate, but others would chose to deal with the content and enjoy it for the piece that it is. Now-a-days to much of the world is involved in drug related misconduct. With these problems in the world being such a large issue, many writers and documentors have chosen to base content on them. Along with unlawful conduct in these books many would feel that these texts set a bad example for the youth today. As we continue to debate if materials such as books, movies, magazines and more should be allowable to be removed from the shelves of our libraries; I conclude in my personal opinion that man and woman should know right from wrong and should be mature as to realizing that these things are a part of our lives but also that they are just works of writing and fuel the lives of knowledge that exist today.",8200,8201.0,Should books  music   movies  magazines  etc  removed shelves libraries based content  This one big questions corporate today many people vocal opinions  With new laws justifications today s society concerning censorship equal rights  people right remove inappropriate content fills libraries  One biggest problems people face today profanity  With foul language haunting everyday conversation home  many people face challenge dealing get material need removing lives completely  Others feel alittle profanity okay part life  exceed border line set certain individuals  With contraditions opinions  much material libraries today would removed valueable knowledge would lost  Many great historic figures used profanity  particularly wartimes  spark moral encouragement  quotes texts remove lives words contributed shaping world live today  Another indulgence become somewhat obsession everyday lives sexual immorality  Many adult reads teenage works involve sexual situations dialogue  With disagreements opinionators  would remove writings re inappropriate  others would chose deal content enjoy piece  Nowadays much world involved drug related misconduct  With problems world large issue  many writers documentors chosen base content  Along unlawful conduct books many would feel texts set bad example youth today  As continue debate materials books  movies  magazines allowable removed shelves libraries  I conclude personal opinion man woman know right wrong mature realizing things part lives also works writing fuel lives knowledge exist today

I didn't tell anyone, or thought much about it later, but imagine a year-old boy coming across it. He might show his mom, and that would be a coversation she wouldn't like to have.

In the library, you can't help but notice what other people are checking out. I have seen middle schoolers looking at magazines with inapropriate photos in them. I have also seen middle schoolers looking at rated movies. I have never heard of a middle schooler who is or older. What bugs me is that the have their own parents check out the movies for them! That isn't necessarly the library's fault, but if the library wouldn't of had those movies in stock, then this problem never would have occured. There are webcites about this topic online.

5591,2,"Libraries are a place in which information is stored. Students go there to reasearch for papers, adults go there to find books on how to improve something, such as their garden, or just the whole public as a whole goes there in order to obtain a book to read. Since libraries are a wealth of information, whether it be found or considered inappropriate and needed to be censored, the library should do its best to have various types of books and educational magazines, while, movies and other types of magazines are more subject to this censorship. A libarary is meant to hold, at the very least, books. Books are one of the most original ways of spreading information, and keeping that information as true. However, when a book is published, it is considered to be aiming for a certain point or audience. There are the children's books, the young adult's novels, and the adult novels. Children's books are often kept in a separate section from the novels that are aimed towards adults, and for good reason. Children are often incapable of understanding what occurs in adult novels, and would be susceptible to inappropriate themes for their age group if the adult novels were placed on the same shelf. It isn't necessary to censor the or remove a book from a public library, when the book in question is capable of being moved to a different section. It's something so radically rational, that it is capable of happening, and of being so. Such as if the book were a in an area that is made up of a majority of a religion that denounces the as a whole, would it be right for the public library to remove it, on account of it being an inappropriate material? If it did, then there would be an outcry. The same with the and It not always be a religious text in question, it just be a mature themed adult novel that's in question, but once the censorship has begun, where shall it end? With magazines, there is a variety of different topics that are explored in them, where there isn't near as much so with books. Such as a magazine dedicated to science and nature, often filled with articles and photos of scenes and ideas that aren't in many books. The is a way that libraries can fill their shelves with science and nature,and even history without having to buy a large and much more expensive book. Although not all magazines are like The they all considerably have their place. Other magazines, such as lack the dearth of information and overall importance that educational magazines contain. Thus, subjecting them to be of less importance, and of also being more subjected to censorship. The library is going to be more open, at least it should be conisdering, that a magazine filled with tips about sex and how to dress the best for the upcoming winter is not what it needs, and also isn't the most appropriate of material. That is an understandable censorship, because in comparison, magazines are much more accessible than books are, which makes them easier for the general public to access. Movies, however, are in a different scale. Many movies, if not a majority, are solely for entertainment. The movies that are considered to be documentaries generally don't do near as well, popularity wise, as the movies about high school or college, or some man and his friends. Thus, making movies a bit more difficult. The documentaries deserve their place in the library, being a place in which knowledge is found, while the box office movies, that are also released in other accessible places, are questionable. The fact that there is such a variation between children's movies, movies aiming for the teenage audience, and movies aimed towards the adults, is what makes it difficult. Which is why the majority of movies, asides from documentaries, really only have a place in a movie renting store, such as or even This way, the movie renting store doesn't have to worry about the library hauling in more people than them, on account of the fact that when someone is a member of a library, then he can rent out as many books or movies for the fee associated with joining. Versus having to pay for each movie rental that he makes, each time he goes there. In the end, everything has its place. Books sincerely belong in a library. Magazines which are to enrich a person's minde and documentaries aiming to educate both have a place in the library. For everything else?

5593,2,"You will hear many people these day complaining about all the censorship in the libraries, honestly i would have to agree with them though. yeah be some books that are considered offensive and rude but its our right to have those books at our hands. We are all mature enough to read these books were in highschool now. If you find a certain book to be offensive to you its not like you have to just keep on reading it you can simply just put it down and return it to the library. See thats the thing about this sensorship, it's not like were and middleschool and giggle over every time an author talks about sex or uses a curse word. just so many books out that seem offensive and yet they could be apart of our nations history. The majority of what is censored be offensive to some but they still carry peoples oppinions and other views wich can be helpful to know. This censorship blokes alot of books that help raise the awarwness of those people in third world countries, of abusive parents, of the starving, and many more improtant topics for certain classes. so why would you set such a huge sensor when it causes more unawared acknowledgment? I think it is because the majority of schools are afraid of what all the parents have to say. they are afraid of critiscm and change. so they block any book that has just a hint of offensive material in it to save them the time and hassil of dealing with a little critiscm. It's not like reading this is going to cause an uotbreak of violence.

5596,2,"'@CAPS1 in todays society are all about censorship. Whether that it be on television, books, news, etc. We all act like thing s are too bad to see when they really are not. Different have different beliefs on what something offensive is. some take to offense what others not. It is just all how you look at it, but no matter what, everyone will find something in their life that is offensive to them. To take a book off a shelf because it have a few things that find offensive to them is appauling in my eyes. are way too far away from reality in the today. are going to see things that offend them whether you like it or not. Think about magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@CAPS5.' some find these magazines offensive but yet we do not care to take them off the shelf in fear of someone be offended. Movies are a big topic that are always onto. Even putting ratings on them warning that this offend you they still seem to have a problem with it. When do we draw the line and say that if it offends you then why bother to even look at it? If something truely does offend you then dont take the effort to make a point about it and just move on without making a big case over something that does not even have to go as far as it is going. I do agree that we as americans say and do things that will offend others. But taking entertainment off of the shelves just to please some few it offends will not sit right in a lot of eyes. The is full of offensive things, and is full of that will always have a say in what stays and what goes. It would be much easier for to take a step back and realize that this is life and you can't have everything that you wish for. Citizens today need to get used to the '@CAPS6 and find some meaning instead of sitting around complaining about things that offend them. It is much easier just to walk away if you are offended then if you make a big deal over it. Children growing up are going to see things and are going to hear things that maybe wrong for young to hear. It is the that we live in today, and you can not stop it even if you tried. Today, that is why they have age requirements that keep immature from witnissing anything that is offensive. For example, in a movie theatre to see a '@CAPS8' rated movie, meaning restriced, you have to be eighteen years of age or older because that is the age you are considered to have an understanding of things and wont be offended over the small things. Yet, that is not good enough for today. Now we want books, and movies taken off the shelf and having things taken off the news. What on earth is that teaching now? growing up will have no understanding, and will have their lives shocked the first time they ever see anything offensive if they are not exposed to it before hand. My father's job has taught me to see things for how they really are and not try to see what i want to see. The today is not going to do you any favors because do not are about your feeling, but only care about what they find as entertainment. In today's society everyone and their brother wants to see something that really isn't there. Brain washed by what they want to see, do not want to be offended, but it is going to happen whether you like it or not. taking books off of the shelf to save someone from having to deal with something that offended them in not right. It will only cause future problems for with protest and start a fight that could have been avoided in the first place. Why call it a free country if you dont even have the right to read something or see something because it offend some It is not fun to be offended but stopping it from happening is just not possible today. All of the things i addressed in this message i really hope you take into deep consideration. If dont want to be offended then dont watch, read, listen to what it is that offends you. Just walk away and act like it never happend. At such a young age i find that i have a great and detailed idea of being offended, mainly, because of what i have grown up around. I personally have not been from many things, and I truelt believe that it has helped me become the person I am today. Someone who is not looking for something to please them or trying to hurt them. I'm just looking at the big picture in life and not worrying about the small things on the side that offend some I will leave you with one last thing to think about. Is taking the time to all these things really worth the time to help the few that are offended by whatever it is? Is it going to hurt us in the long run.

The reason that I think that is if it offends one person it dose not mean that it offends all of the people. People are all different and all of different opinions on things and people all have different ways of doing things. I think its wrong for people to remove books, movies, and magszines from the self because if every one was aloud to get rid of offensive things to them at the librarie soon there wouldnt be any thing left on the selfs for anyone to read. I think they sould have votes as a community to choose the books that get removed from the librarie. Like books about drugs and breaking the law. These books could leave a negitive impact on a kids life and cause them to make the wrong desision and end up to be a troubble maker or a drug addict and end up in prison.But then again books that tell you the negitive affects about drugs and how bad they are can be a good thing becuase they can impact a kids life and make them not wanna ever try them.

5601,2,"There have been a lot of issues involving the censorship in libraries. Some parents find materials to be inappropriate for their child and wish to have them taken out. My views on cenosorship in libraries is that it is ok to have the books, music, movies, or magazines with possibly inappropriate information in it. The parents of the child can prevent their child from viewing or listening to them if they don't think it's appropriate. Something parents might find things inappropriate in their context, such as inappropriate language, sex, drug use, or fighting. Some children might not understand what some of those things are because they never learned correctly by their parents so it is a way to learn new things. Yes, some of the things might be bad, but most of the other information can be helpful. I don't think that they should remove books, music, movies, or magazines that contain inappropriate information because the parents are ultimatly incharge of their child and what they read or view. If a parent isn't comfortable with letting their child read or hear something that might be inappropriate then they shouldn't allow them to view it. Some parents might think that the same material is inappropriate, it all depends on the parent's views. If a parent has no problem with their child viewing some of the things in the libraries then it shouldn't be taken out and the child should get the chance to view it. Books and movies are about the way life is, so when a child reads a book or watches a movie they will be getting some life experiances and it will help them. There can be some inappropriate parts in movies, books, music, and magazines, but if the child doesn't do anything about it then it shouldn't be too much of a problem. If a child read a book about fighting or saw a movie about fighting and then went out and got in a fight that would be a problem, but that doesn't mean that that book or movie shouldn't be allowed to be read by other children. People take information differently, some take it literally and have to try it out while some are fine and move on after they finish the book or movie. In a book or in movies people usually have sex when they love each other, so it would teach the child to only do that when they are sure. Some kids might be so interested in it they might try it as soon as they can, but the majority won't. Books, movies, music, and magazines can be very informational. They can teach you how to build things or how to make a good breakfast, but in some parent's eyes they can also teach their children that doing drugs and other illegal things are ok and acceptable. If a child reads a book about someone who does drugs, do you think they'll look up to the person after they see the affects it has on that person? Of course not, in the media and at school they might learn it's cool to do drugs because everyone else does it, but in a book they can see what actually happens. If the parents never got around to teaching the kid right and wrong it might be a substitute for them because it will persuade them not to do drugs, or have sex until their married. If a child watches a movie or reads a book that is about fighting they might become violent and use that to hurt other people, but they could also use it for self-defense if they need to. If a child is getting bullied and it becomes physical they would need a way to defend themself, but if they watched a lot of fighting movies or read a lot of fighting books they would know what to do. I can understand why some parents might think some materials are inappropriate for their children. Their children are their babies and they don't want to open them up to a world of bad things so they want to protect them. If the child doesn't learn at an early age what some of those things are they could have problems later on in life, their parents need to let them learn things on their own. Some materials can be a little inapropriate for younger children, but some kids hear worse things at school than they read about in a book or hear in a song. Some kids need to learn what some of the things are and if you take the resources out of the libraries they'll learn from unreliable sources.

5603,2,"Society is run by control. All things big or small can relate to a time when they feel there is to much take and not enough give: imbalance of control. In our economy, control is something devoid of the middle class, owned by the rich, and sought after by the politicians. To ask the question on censorship knocks on the same door. How should the media be controlled? The fact is, should not. Just like the hourglass of power in has taken its own course, The access of information in our countries libraries should be let to take own course. Doing otherwise would be sadley hypocritical.Information is sought after by all people. Whether be books, television news stations, or we all want to know the truth about what is going on in the present or what happened in the past. The control issue is age old however. In the times, The higherups used the to control peoples minds and take advantage of them. Today the political leaders are not using spiritual beleifs as a way to control us but instead they use power, or the lack there of, of knowledge. The government can easily keep information from us without us knowing. If they so choose they could keep us from knowing what goes on beyond the shores of the US.

We would become a stagnant pit for nothing but whatever we know to be true: and Humans are not dogs that go for walks, eat, sleep, and poop. Though they do do these things, humans are also engines of creativity that never stop moving forward. Censoring the media would only serve to stop this incredible production engine. Censorship is not the type of control that I want to see in my life. I would much rather see control as something that I have as individual, something not just owned by the intelligent few. Some argue that ignorance is bliss. Bliss, however, is not what got us to where we are today. Turn that around and say bliss is ignorance.

5604,2,"Everyone is aware of it. Everyone knows what good and bad it can do. Everyone is either for or against it. If you are for it, you will stand by it, even though there might be fights over along the way. If you are against it, you will do anything to have your beliefs enforced. What am I talking about? I am talking about censorship. My three main points are why censorship is a bad thing, what anti-censorship can do for you, and what you can do for anti-censorship. First and foremost, censorship is a very bad thing. When you censor what someone is saying, you are revoking their freedom of speech. We should all be allowed to say what we want at any time and place. If we just censored out everything that people don't want to hear, we would never have any great leaders or role models in our society-past and present. By censoring something someone says, you are telling them that you do not care about them, and that they should practically live happy simple lives, but, life is not simple and we don't have any right to tell someone what they can and cannot say. Maybe you will argue that censorship is for the children, no. The children will hear worse words and phrases just by being with their parents and friends. Censorship is really for adults who do not want to face reality or have different ideas. So no, I do not believe that certian materials should be taken off the shelves. It gives you your own right to read whatever you want and you start to compare the materials with other materials and you find out what you really think is right. You might tell someone because they might have ideas too, and you have a discussion about it. With two people having a conversation, you can develop ideas off of them also. Nothing gets solved without input. What anti-censorship can do for you is that it can change your world and your views on how different people percieve it. With anti-censorship you are allowing everyone to have their own views and inputs on things that you not have noticed or thought hardly on. Anti-censorship is for the people who are not afraid to take a stand. Sure, you read or hear something uncensored and think that it is really harsh, but it's reality-anything could happen. Everybody has their different ideas and if we use those ideas, maybe other people will put in their ideas and we will actually have a big melting pot of awesome ideas. Nothing gets solved without input. '@CAPS1 not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country,' is a quote by a past president, We need to think the same way about anti-censorship. We need to be okay with all of the bad in the world that is going on. We need to live our lives. We cannot change the world, and we cannot cover up the bad. An astronaut was in space looking down on the world and thought, 'what a beautiful world, so peaceful looking, from here no one would think that there is so much bad in it,' and he was right. Censorship is trying to cover up what someone is saying, what they believe, how they percieve the world. By covering up certain subjects, it makes the world completely left in the dark. We need to know more about what is going on We need to come into the light and away from the dark. We need to hear what is really happening. Nothing gets solved without input.

5605,2,"Some people find books offensive. But have you ever considered your favorite book being offensive to someone else? Probably not, usually we wouldn't even consider it. But in this case we have to. Some books that we read could be considered inappropriate or offensive. But does this mean that they need to be taken off of the shelves? No, because there are people that must enjoy reading theos books. If we took off the books that at least one person found offensive there would not be any books left on the shelves. If someone does not like the book they are reading then they do not have to read it, it is their decision whether they do or not. Another reason why they should not be taken off the shelf is because it would be their opinion whether the book is offensive or not. I think that the books and libraries should censor books. For example one way to have them censor would be having to be so old to read an adult fiction book. Or you could have your parents sign a consent paper saying that it is fine if you read that kind of a book or not. That way it will not be a problem for anyone and you can read the kinds of books that you want, without having to take them off of the shelves. Books should not be taken off of the shelves if someone finds them offensive. There is at least one person that enjoys that book. So let them have their book while we have all the other to enjoy. If you do not like the book then do not read it. But that does not mean that every one else does not like it either.

5606,2,"To be censored or not to be censored. It has been heavily debated for a long time as to whether it is necessary to cenor books or not. While many people say that this is something that needs to be done others disagree. Censoring materials could mean that we miss out on the message that the author is sending us but sometimes it is best that some things people say are better left unsaid. I believe that censorship is necessary on some text, but to a certain degree, I believe that censoring some published text is a bit too extreme. I believe that censorship on children's books is understandable, but censorship on many adult books is not needed. Some of the things that authors put in their children's books can cause children to form opinions about people and things way too early in life. If the author is talking about and segregation in such a way throughout her story this could cause the child to believe that they should shun They start to wonder why people used to shun them, but they are not old enough to understand this information at such a young age. There are only certain things that children should be exposed to at a young age. Other things that are more diverse or things that have happend in history should be kept silent about until children are more mature and understand better. Magazines have pictures and stories authors seem to push to the limit as far as they can go without getting fired. Aisles in grocery stores are all filled with magazines telling the day to day stuggles of celebrities. I believe that the gossip stories that are headlines on most magazines critizing celebrities needs to be censored. Most of the time, these magazines tell all of the personal issues that celebrities are having: divorces, child custody, relationship issues or drug problems. These are all stuggles that these people are having and putting their lives out on the front page of magazines does not seem right, especially when they usually only have half of the story true. These articles should only include very basic details of the celebrities personal life or none at all. Although childrens books and magazines should be censored, I think that many of our adult books should not. Most adults know of the things that go on around the world and past history events that have shaped religion and different groups of people. We know that there are things that go on in our world that are not good. Reading books such as autobiographies about people that have been through struggles such as the holocaust, war, or an abusive childhood can help us relate to how they feel and what they went through in life. It is through these stories that we can really connect with them and we can learn even more in depth about what happend then just what we see on the outside looking in. Censorship is necessary to a point. Censorship should not defeated or covered up the point of a story. It should be to make sure material that is not suitable is not read. The debate of censorship goes on but for some text it is best to and others it is not",8234,8235.0,To censored censored  It heavily debated long time whether necessary cenor books  While many people say something needs done others disagree  Censoring materials could mean miss message author sending us sometimes best things people say better left unsaid  I believe censorship necessary text  certain degree  I believe censoring published text bit extreme  I believe censorship children s books understandable  censorship many adult books needed  Some things authors put children s books cause children form opinions people things way early life  If author talking segregation way throughout story could cause child believe shun They start wonder people used shun  old enough understand information young age  There certain things children exposed young age  Other things diverse things happend history kept silent children mature understand better  Magazines pictures stories authors seem push limit far go without getting fired  Aisles grocery stores filled magazines telling day day stuggles celebrities  I believe gossip stories headlines magazines critizing celebrities needs censored  Most time  magazines tell personal issues celebrities  divorces  child custody  relationship issues drug problems  These stuggles people putting lives front page magazines seem right  especially usually half story true  These articles include basic details celebrities personal life none  Although childrens books magazines censored  I think many adult books  Most adults know things go around world past history events shaped religion different groups people  We know things go world good  Reading books autobiographies people struggles holocaust  war  abusive childhood help us relate feel went life  It stories really connect learn even depth happend see outside looking  Censorship necessary point  Censorship defeated covered point story  It make sure material suitable read  The debate censorship goes text best others
5607,2,"Do you ever look at a material in a library and you can't help but be completely appaulled? You could ask around and find many diverse opinions on the subject. Personally, I believe any material you wouldn't present to your grandparents, parents, or child should be removed from any public library that could be in reach of the population under the age of eighteen. When you have a child or children, any parently would greatly agree they are not of age for certain prospects. Parents select materials age appropiate for their child. So think, if your child/children went to the local library and came home with an article on a topic that is extremely negative in their learning. Would you ignore it or let your child adventure about the topics you were postponing for a later time? This is an obsticles you are faced with when libraries allow any random material entering their doors. Libraries open to the public for rent or purchase of books, music, movies, etc. runs a risk of you seeing something you aren't going to be infatuated with. Everyone is different, therefore they will be interested in different aspects. For instance, the variety of music genres. There is anything from folk to rap. Libraries holding any music the is exclipt in language and activities, should be the main priorty to remove or place in a section not allowing kids. I strongly disapprove of material representing provocative items. Generally in a library you will find a wide variety of magazines. You would not believe some of the articles libraries allow to be read by the generation today. Some of the popular magazines in the world are etc. are not for all eyes. Libraries that introduced these articles should take drastic measures to making postive no child under the age of eighteen are veiwing them. Wouldn't it be extrodinary to know you could step into a library and be overwhelmed with a feeling of respect. All libraries should honestly ponder the thought of removing the inapropriate displays.

5608,2,"Censorship in libraries can be very effective with some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. I believe that if the library owns material that could be considered offensive that they should either have to get rid of it, keep it out of the way of the public, or have people special request it. Many books now-a-days have some racial slurrs, religious beliefs, and opinions stuck inside the front cover. In my personal opinion, libraries should not be allowed to sell or give out any type of material that is too offensive or inappropriate. Thousands of people all over the world read daily. What if a nine year old got ahold of a book at a public library that was filled with curse words and then they started repeating them because they thought it was okay? This wouldn't be okay with any type of parent and shouldn't happen. I believe that this goes the same with magazines. You can get magazines just about anywhere. Some magazines are filled with so many subjects that no one would want a child getting the knowledge of. Music and movies are known and loved by millions and millions of people. Some music types such as rap, country, reggae, etc. don't usually have the best quality in lyrics. I have recently been to a library and a year old was begging his mom to buy him a This was totally inappropriate. I thought to myself '@CAPS4 would a library sell these types of things where the footprints of little children stand?' I'm still not quite sure but it isn't my place to tell them they cannot. Another subject that worries me is the fact that libraries sell all different types of movies; I'm mostly concerned with the and the rated movies. These types of movies are filled blood, gore, violence, drugs, and sometimes sexual acts of nature. This is something that many kids should not be watching. But if the kid has a friend old enough or a sibling that doesn't really care what they see they can easily buy or rent a movie, and let the child watch it. Lastly, to every issue there is a compromise. I most definitely believe that children under fourteen should not be allowed to possess any of these materials unless they are with their guardian, and they must sign for it. They could also keep these items out in the views for public if they label it as '@CAPS6 or '@NUM3 AND They could even have a list of adult movies and/or music that people have to ask personally for. Just to be safe that young children don't actually get the item themselves from a public place. In conclusion, I have given my opinion about what I believe should happen with the censorship in libraries. Some of many books and magazines have inappropriate language and sometimes pictures. Music and movies contain vulgar language and obscure viewing imagery many times. If libraries wish to sell or let people rent these items I believe that they should have to make a sign stating who can buy this item, or have a list posted of adult movies that people have to special request to get them.",8238,8239.0,Censorship libraries effective books  music  movies  magazines  etc  I believe library owns material could considered offensive either get rid  keep way public  people special request  Many books nowadays racial slurrs  religious beliefs  opinions stuck inside front cover  In personal opinion  libraries allowed sell give type material offensive inappropriate  Thousands people world read daily  What nine year old got ahold book public library filled curse words started repeating thought okay  This would nt okay type parent nt happen  I believe goes magazines  You get magazines anywhere  Some magazines filled many subjects one would want child getting knowledge  Music movies known loved millions millions people  Some music types rap  country  reggae  etc  nt usually best quality lyrics  I recently library year old begging mom buy This totally inappropriate  I thought   CAPS would library sell types things footprints little children stand   I m still quite sure nt place tell  Another subject worries fact libraries sell different types movies  I m mostly concerned rated movies  These types movies filled blood  gore  violence  drugs  sometimes sexual acts nature  This something many kids watching  But kid friend old enough sibling nt really care see easily buy rent movie  let child watch  Lastly  every issue compromise  I definitely believe children fourteen allowed possess materials unless guardian  must sign  They could also keep items views public label   CAPS   NUM AND They could even list adult movies andor music people ask personally  Just safe young children nt actually get item public place  In conclusion  I given opinion I believe happen censorship libraries  Some many books magazines inappropriate language sometimes pictures  Music movies contain vulgar language obscure viewing imagery many times  If libraries wish sell let people rent items I believe make sign stating buy item  list posted adult movies people special request get 
5609,2,"Dear views on cencorship in a are simple, not everyone is the same, and i dont think it would be fair to remove all of the so called 'offensive' material just so other people dont get mad. Alot of people go to libraries, and not all those people are going to want the same kind of book. I think it is a matter of opinion. There is all sorts of different kinds of books out there, like sports, drama, horror, fiction and non fiction. If you are in a and see a book that has something that might be offensive to you, just ignore it. There are probably some parents out there that will disagree with this because they might have little kids that they dont want to see these kinds of things, but most libraries have adult sections, and childeren sections. Its not like the or librarian puts offensive things on the shelves just for the fun of it. Its there job, they know that not everyone has the same taste in books. So they throw a little bit of everything in there. One time I was at the looking for a good book to read. I was there for quite some time, going down every isle, looking through all the shelves. With me being a big sports fan, and athlete, ofcourse i went straight to the sports section. I came across a book that was titled '@CAPS6 is a but just happens to be of choice. I ignored it though, i kept on looking and looking until i found book, and i finally did. So point is, is that i dont think anyone has the right to remove a book they dont like from a shelf just because they think it is offensive. That book that one person is removing, could be a book someone else likes and is looking for, and maybe that book is the only kind of book that certain person will read. sincerely,",8240,8241.0,Dear views cencorship simple  everyone  dont think would fair remove called offensive  material people dont get mad  Alot people go libraries  people going want kind book  I think matter opinion  There sorts different kinds books  like sports  drama  horror  fiction non fiction  If see book something might offensive  ignore  There probably parents disagree might little kids dont want see kinds things  libraries adult sections  childeren sections  Its like librarian puts offensive things shelves fun  Its job  know everyone taste books  So throw little bit everything  One time I looking good book read  I quite time  going every isle  looking shelves  With big sports fan  athlete  ofcourse went straight sports section  I came across book titled   CAPS happens choice  I ignored though  kept looking looking found book  finally  So point  dont think anyone right remove book dont like shelf think offensive  That book one person removing  could book someone else likes looking  maybe book kind book certain person read  sincerely 
5610,2,"To whom it concern: I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I believe that there will always be something that is going to offend somebody. If every person was able to choose something that they wanted to be taken off of a shelf because it offends them as a person, then what would be left? Most likely every single book in our school library is over some topic that offends at least one person. But for every one person that is offended by that topic, there is still at least one person that actually enjoys it. They wouldn't be too happy about not being able to read it would they? This kind of goes with the saying everyone knows, '@CAPS1 others how you want to be treated.' You wouldn't want your favorite book series to be taken off a shelf because it offends someone else would you? No, you probably don't. So we should all be fair to one another. I can remember in middle school there was a book series I was reading that I really did enjoy. There were four books and I had just finished the third one, so I went to the library to return it and grab the last one to read. I was so disappointed when the librarian told me she didn't have the book and wouldn't be getting it either. When she explained to me that there was the possibility of it offending someone, I immediately understood. I was still not too happy about it later on, but I knew I had to be fair to other people also. So in conclusion, I do see where people are coming from when they want to take away the things that offend them. I don't want to see the things that offend me either. However, we all need to come to an understanding that no, we aren't all going to like the same things and no, we don't necessarily want to have to look at it all the time, but we all have to be fair to one another to keep the world a peaceful place.",8242,8243.0,To concern  I believe certain materials books  music  movies  magazines  etc  removed shelves found offensive  I believe always something going offend somebody  If every person able choose something wanted taken shelf offends person  would left  Most likely every single book school library topic offends least one person  But every one person offended topic  still least one person actually enjoys  They would nt happy able read would  This kind goes saying everyone knows    CAPS others want treated   You would nt want favorite book series taken shelf offends someone else would  No  probably nt  So fair one another  I remember middle school book series I reading I really enjoy  There four books I finished third one  I went library return grab last one read  I disappointed librarian told nt book would nt getting either  When explained possibility offending someone  I immediately understood  I still happy later  I knew I fair people also  So conclusion  I see people coming want take away things offend  I nt want see things offend either  However  need come understanding  nt going like things  nt necessarily want look time  fair one another keep world peaceful place

If there are offensive books it should be seprated from the adults and kids sholud have no type of access to them. Im not a parent yet but I know when I become one I would not want my child to read things like collection of books are books full of sex images and talk.Those are things kids shouldn't be reading.Thoses books in that nature could put a bad influence on kids and they could grow up thinking thats right. My generation think it is and i wouldn't want the next to do the same. I would want them to be better. Children should not be exposed to thoses things. It should be removed from the shelve so there isn't any access.Also seperating them from adults could also be a good idea. Well I come from a school where it just seems like sex,skipping, and having babies are a big deal instead of doing work and going to class.My generation barely reads and when they do read,thats exactly what they read offensive things and basically books. I have never read a book book but from what I always hear about them are just full of sex.I think the library showed kids its okay to read things like that because they are one the shelves just ready to be tooken down for children to read. I observed that thoses books do us no good because people get caught up all in the book and so amazed and intrested. While nothing else cacthes their attention but the bad things they see on shelves.Children are lazy and don't put much work into anything. If they weren't there I don't think things children would go seek those books.They see it as an open oppurtunity because it's there. I believe there is no turning back on my generation to help them but libraries can do something as small as removing offensive books from their section and open their eyes to real novels that mean something. Books that make them intrested,about our culture and our background could be so good for the smaller children. I know everyone sees how it for this generation of kids and I believe the library can make that step so it could get better and better. If kids are focused on reading those good things and not offensive it's a big chance those kids will be more intrested in school. Also reading can help for thinking deeper and get under the surface of what something is really saying. In conclusion, the offensive books for children should not be of access to them. They should be seperated with the adults. Just starting at the books at the library can have a change on the children of the next generation so they can be better.

5613,2,"Dear Newspaper, As a teenager I have been involved in many situations where I shouldn't be and have heard things from other teens that I know I should not hear. As children we have grown up in a world that is very politically correct, but we are around things that we shouldn't be around at such a young age. I believe that when it comes to school and libraries and the items found in libraries that somethings should be more cautious then they are. When I say this I mean that sometimes students leave the library with books, music, movies, etc and they probably shouldn't leave with those things. Sometimes as children we get defensive easily when people say that we can't do or have certain things, but there is a reason they say no to those things. There are just somethings in life that we shouldn't experience so young. I believe that books and etc should not necessarly be removed from libraries but like I said early somethings should be watched over. There are times when we forget to return a book or music or magazine and we have to pay late fees, and there are times when we check out books we never even begin to read. This world that we live in is so politcally correct that people are offended by things that are natural in life. We as children have to experience things in life so we know what to do and what not to do. I know that there are books that the library provides that are derogitory and have cursing in it, and be innappropriate but they are there for a reason. Through the books I have read I have learned a lot. They have meaning and we read them in school for certain reasons. As well as the music in our generation, yes it is very innappropiate a lot of the time but if you really listen to it, it has meaning. What I'm trying to get at is we shouldn't be sheltered by the things in life or the things in a library. They should not be cencorsed to keep us 'safe' and to 'not offend' people. In conclusion I have come to realization that our world is not perfect nor are the things that are in it. We can not be held back from what life has in it. I know that adults want the best for us and maybe censoring libraries will make the world 'better', but in all actually it won't. We will never learn how to learn from mistakes if we don't make them. We will never be a better person through our trials and errors if we never have anything to mess up on. As humans none of us our perfect. We should not censor libraries because people are offended, we should only open their eyes to see that each and every book and music in the library has greater meaning than what it gives off, it was someones hard work and time and effort put to make it. I think that censoring libraries would only cause more of a problem because people wouldn't feel like they had the freedom to read, listen to, or watch what they wanted to watch. As americans and people of this world we will all have different opinions and views on things. There is always going to be someone who won't agree with you, but there will always be someone who does agree with you. So for the simple fact that we have the freedom to be what we want to be, we shouldn't censor libraries because that would only be causing a problem amongst people. If you are a person that doesn't return books try harder to return them or just don't check them out to begin with. We all have to work together so we can have nice libraries and not a ton of people that are offended by this situation.

Also in that room should be things that could offend people, such as books that are about religion. Some poeple be very offended by the books that talk bad about their religion. We all know that people can get very deffensive about their kids and their religon etc. Libraries need to think about how these people react and think about if they want their library to be a place where people dont let their kids go because of some inappropriate or offensive things.

Also you have seen someone who has been offended by a book, movie, cd, etc. Most people see a library as somewhere that you go with you kids or family or even by yourself to read, work on homework, or just enjoy the quiet. People dont think of a library as a bad place. That is until they see something they dont like. People want the library to be a wonderful kid friendly place that they can relax at.

5616,2,"Do you enjoy reading, music, and movies? How would you react if your favorites were taken off the shelf? Should libraries be sencered for young children? Perhaps they should not for personal referances. To begin with, people all around the world enjoy reading different subjects at any age. Some have a much higher reading level than others, and different personal likings. By taking books off the shelf, you are limiting those who can actually read them. They deserve to stay on the shelves if it be '@CAPS3,' or It would not be fair to those who enjoy the books taken. In addition, music is a very popular thing. It ranges from quiet, soothing instramentle to loud, crazy metel bands. There are some people who are so tuned to their music, that if they do not have it they can have very strong mood swings. Taking the opertunity away from children to discover new musical foundations isn't very wise. All children, no matter the age, should rightfully have their chance to choose what they like, and dislike. Also, movies are one of the most common, and cliche thing to do these days. They are filled with adventure, action, love, horror, and suspence. Children growing up need to develop an imagination. For example, children are told of to spark an imagination. This is another opertunity that they deserve to have. There is a child section in almost every library; showing that they others are not taken off the shelf, and are avalable to the people. All in all, public libraries are for people of any age, and should be able to accomidate everyones personal needs. Therefore, everything such as books, music, and movies should stay on the shelf. By doing so, it is like telling people what they can, and cannot read.

They had all types of movies in the different areas of the store, and I as you would be walking out of the store they had a few movies for sale. Thats where they had some movies that just wasn't sutiable for children under eighteen. I being under eighteen was shocked they had those types of movies out on a shelf, To me was very inproper to have those movies out just on the shelf. I could see a store some types of movies like that but they should have them in a area where small children can't just wonder around and be looking at those types of movies. This goes for general stores to, eighteen and plus magazines out on the shelfs while small childrens books a few spots down. I for one think we should be able to file a complaint about the item and where being placed in side of a store or a rental store. is the owner of the buisness going to know if some of there customers find that offensive? There would need to be away of communication between customers and owner to notify him of this. I'm sure some stores have those types of items out to caught a customers eyes. seen some of these books, movies, and magazines first hand. I wouldn't want my children to see that type of items. is just a more sutiable situation if the owners of the stores have that more hidden or blocked off area inside of a store for those items. children with you looking for a good movie or book. Its hard to just by pass those types of items with out any of them asking what those movies or books are about. puts parents into a tough spot on should they explain or they should just say don't worry about Coming to a libary wouldn't a parent think that is a safe zone for children. Thats not always the case. parents should worry about what there children are getting into. Come on now, a libary we are talking about a place to find helpful information. Not a place to be finding offensive content for adults. One thing for sure is that children shouldn't be exsposed to that material why they are young could cause problems in later years. With they might grow up or who they turn into as a adult. bad enough now with all the offensive material that is online and on tv, and just what the kids here at school. They don't need to see or hear at a libary. Hearing and seeing that type of material all the time just isn't good. they could be reading the bible or listening to something that doesn't have all of the bad language in or have the nudity in the movies or on tv. Someone needs to stand up and start saying something about and get all of that junk away from our children.

On top of not listening and being a constant pain, also doesn't make the grades that she should. She slacks off in class and barely gets by with making low grades.

Once she gets home from school, mom now has to deal with She is always screaming in books and causing problems for parents, but especially mom. doesn't like to listen to and she never does what mom asks of Disobeying your parents is wrong and should not be encouraged through a book. Encouraging it though, is exactly what the book '@PERSON1' does. It makes it look like it is okay to misbehave towards your parents. Parents deserve respect and obediance from their kids. How can young children get that message if this book is teaching them the exact opposite? Not only is a trouble-maker in school and cruel to mom, she is also a mess-maker. In books she shows lack of care when she dirties something and then does not clean up after herself. She does this with room, dishes, and any other room she seems to enter. is always making some kind of disaster and expects to have someone clean it up for It seems mother is always yelling at to get back and clean something up that she had just left.Teaching kids to not clean up after themselves could become a problem for them in the future with jobs or their own homes. books should be taken off the shelves in stores and libraries. They can teach kids the wrong things in life such as slacking off in school, not listening to their own parents, and not cleaning up after them selves.

5619,2,"Is censorship of materials in a library an ethical thing to do? Most people, to a certain degree, say yes. I however, say no. Censorship takes away a person's right to choose, there right to look at what they desire to. And frankly, the choice of what should be censored is arbitrary, and varies from person to person. All of these issues bring a logical person to the conclusion that, no books and other types of media should not be censored in libraries, or anywhere similiar. The points made are somewhat vague, so allow me to ellaborate. To begin with, is the person's right to choose. Everyone should have the right to choose what they as a person want to see. Censoring books takes away this right. When you censor, you are removing the potential choice for someone to pick up the book, or other media, and forumlate their own opinion about whether or not they want to see that material. The people who don't want to see it have the choice not to look at it, and the poeple who do wish to see it are free to do so. The option to look not appeal to some, but the option is there. Another is that the people who want to see the censored media in question, are no longer free to do so. To the people who don't want to see it, this is a great thing. But for the others, the people who do wish to see, this is taking away their rights to view it. The people who wish to see something that is censored, a book for example, be in the minority, but they still should be able to choose on their own. The final is how arbitrary the decision is. Who is to say what is and isn't appropriate to view? The issue with this is that the appropriateness, or offensiveness, of something is all relative to the person who is looking at it. One person find something completely acceptable, while another person finds that same object to be moraly repugnent. So then who make the decision of what is okay to censor? The answer to a question like that in reality, isn't just black and white. Censorship is often a hard subject to talk about. The stances on whether it is acceptable or not vary greatly. But most people agree, the right to your choice is a very important one, one that shouldn't be taken away by anyone. So should libraries censor what is in and isn't in them?

I mean have you ever sat on a school bus, with the kids of now, and heard just how many of them cuss? If not, you sould it would show you just how much they have been exposted to at their age.

How many people, would you say, that like to watch And out of them people how many, do you think, have kids that watch it with them? I would said about half or maybe more then that. So theres what, a little less then over half of todays youth being showed 'bad' and 'wrong' things. Magazines are more then a good show of how todays youth is being changed or molded into what kind of people the worlds want them to be and not what the want to be. So in a way it takes away the divisrty that is the world, just a little bit. Without divisrty you or I would be the same. So what kind of world would that be? Everyone would think the same, do the same thing, and act the same. And I don'@CAPS1 think that's the kind of world anyone would want to live in. Music is a way to show who you are on the inside, if your sad then it will show that, if your angery then it will show that. Like I stated before, taking away someones persona is wrong and to take away some music would be like taking away my persona. What would you do if you saw a man standing on the street, singing or playing something. Would you think '@CAPS4 he's poor and just wants money!'. Or would you think that maybe he just wants the world to hear how he feels? So in short, I think censorship is both good and bad. Bad in the way that if little kids watch, say '@CAPS5 what would they get out of it? Nothing but bad words and that drinking or what not is cool.

5621,2,"In the citizens have so many freedoms and make many decisions for othemselves. We decide how to run our lives, and we can live the way we want to with a few exceptions. Included in our self-made decisions is how we would like to be entertained. There are so many different forms of entertainment in this country, but very common forms are books, music, movies, and magazines. Some forms of entertainment are described as innapropriate for certain age groups and parents be concerned about their children recieving offensive material. If someone from a different culture was offended by you eating pork, would you stop eating it? Most people would answer this questions with a no because we have to freedom to choose what we want. In comparison, books, movies, and music should not be removed from bookshelves because they might be found offensive by certain people. Authors and directors of books and films have varied styles of writing. They have the freedom to write whatever they want, however they want. Some of their work is directed towards certain people and that certain group of people not be you. But you do not have the right to take that piece of work away from the rest of the public because you find it offensive. If the reader is not a fan of the work or thinks that it is innapropiate, then he or she should simply return it to the library and leave it there for someone with a different taste in books/movies to enjoy. In our country today, movies are rated so that children can not watch innapropriate films with out the consent of their guardians. This greatly helps with concened parents. In the library, books are not rated but if a parent is concerned about what their child is reading/watching, then that is a family concern that should be dealt with at home. It is not a concern with what the library puts out there for the public. There are many books and movies that could have offensive material such as drugs, sex, alcohol, racism, etc. Personally, I know that I have picked out a book from my school library that was definitely not what I was looking for. It had content dealing with drugs and sex. I never actually finished the book, so I do not know if it turned out to be a good book or not. All I had to do was return it to the library and it was excluded from my entertainment options. 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else,' said Katherine Paterson, a modern day author. This quote shows how certain freedoms in the prove that books, movies, magazines, and music should be left on the shelves at the libraries. Authors have the freedom to write, readers/viewers have the freedom to read or view, and libraries have the freedom to provide. Everyone has a different style and all of those styles should be respected equally. They do not have to be agreed with, but respect is very neccessary.

5622,2,"Censoring the that your mind was trapped in a little white box. This box had no windows, no mirrors, no doors. Just a simple, plain, empty box. Does this not sound boring and terrible? This, to me, sounds like censorship. A world locked away and shielded from whatever imagination or truths one can find. While there be some times where censorship should be encouraged, the majority of people do not need to be blocked from the written or spoken word. Most people censor on a daily basis; they censor their speech and writing. This takes place in the mind before the words have left their mouths or the pen has touched the paper. This is a fine way to censor, as it shows respect to your surroundings and it happens before the words are released. The problem with censoring comes when someone tries to shield the public from the already written or spoken word. This seems like a crime to humanity, and is almost conterproductive in its attempts. For example: if a school has a list of books banned from its library, and a student found the list, do you not have the feeling that student would suddenly be more interested in those books on the list than the books already on the shelf? Many of my friends attend 'banned book' festivals, along with thousands of others. If censoring just attracts the common person, maybe we should stop looking to it to hide our problems. Censoring is also seen, by some, as a way of lying to the people. Just because someone wrote a book and someone else marked out their thoughts does not mean that these thoughts did not take place. Humans are similiar in a way that when one person has a thought, you can almost always find someone else who has had that same or similiar thought themselves. So why censor the thoughts that get printed, especially if they do not stop the thoughts in our heads? The other disturbing issue that comes with censorship is the fact that when someone censors us, we are giving the power to our knowledge to that person. They cut us off and feed us bits of information they feel we can handle. This is a frightening thought! When one reads a newspaper, they hope to get the full honest truth from that newspaper and not just what someone wants us to read. If there is any place in the world that should not be censored, it is a library. A library is an organization funded by tax dollars to give a community the ability to research or find entertainment in books and computers. As a future tax paying citizen, I would be outraged to find books have been censored in a library in which I help pay for. It is more offensive to hide the work of an author than it is to read whatever horrible thing the person could have penned. All in all, censorship is not acceptable. The people of the world have the ability to think and make decisions for themselves and should not have their mind altered to the thinking of someone with a marker.

5623,2,"Censorship in libraries is something that helps to keep children away from harmful and adult like content. Not all libraries are for just children. Adults, young teens, and children can attend a library for many reasons. Books take a big part in research for school, reading for fun, or even facts for work. There are many different types of books that are available. What if there was an important book that maybe an adult or young teen needed? Would you want to take away from their educational time? Censorship is not always a right way to go. Going to the library, there are many things that you can do. Reading of course is the main activity you can do. At a library there are always computers for people to be on. If you go to school and need a place to have a study group or even do homework it is a liable place to be. There are many different maturity levels between adults and children. Depending on what the library showcases, or maybe the types of books they hold, it might be more for adults. Being a parent you should know where your kid is, and trust them for what they do. If you can't trust your kid to be responsible, then do you not think that you should keep them away from the negative. Libraries are not negative it is just the information in some books, or some that are displayed require to be a little mature about it. Kids these days do pick up things they see and hear from adults and elders they are around, but that is not the only thing. A kid can easily read a book that has either drugs or sex involved situations that trigger something inside of them. Next thing you know, your kids are doing these non explainable things that you never thought they would. Kids should be monitored and so should books, music, movies, and magazines they offer at a library. There are many aspects to being appropriate for kids. Books, music, etc. should not have foul language, drugs, sex, or gang related issues. If any do, it should be for young teens or adults that can handle that type of maturity. Offensive aspects that might have a book or anything else taken off the shelf would be if it was something negative towards a religion or race. People might follow a religion heavily and then there are books that offend them with a tradition or thing they might do in their house hold. Those type of books be asked not to display. Sometimes though, the books religious people do not want displayed are the books people need for research purposes with work or school. With the whole racial issue it could be anything that happened historically. Some take it offensive because they did not agree with what happened in those events. Those books can also be helpful in research for work or school. Being asked to not display those would only help them not everyone else. It is most likely a self opinionated situation when someone thinks a book should be removed. In the quote Katherine Paterson wrote she mentioned '....And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' With Katherine's quote being said, some believe that be right. Personally, I completely agree with Katherine. If someone does not like a book, what about the rest? Then there would not be any books for other people. Basically what she is saying is that when people have their own opinions on books or materials held in a library it is not always just about them. Do they ever think of the other people that might want to review that item? Doubtful as the situation seem, they are just going to have to include insight for other people besides themselves.

5624,2,Everyone has their own opinion on different things in life wether it seems important or not. I believe that everyone should have the same rights. But you must draw a line somewhere between appropreate and not. I believe that offensive material should be removed from the shelves. Nobody wants to see a childs innocense be taken away just by opening and seeing a picture in a book or hearing a bad word on the radio. Kids these days are learning things at such a younger age. I personally know graders that have learned things from songs and shows that i didn't know about till i was much older. Parents and role models play a big role with kids and teens by showing and teaching them what shows to watch and not watch or music to listen to and avoid. They must teach them what is right and wrong and monitor what their child does. So that they can stay away from the things they don't need to learn about or hear. Everyone does have their own rights and it would be difficult to keep everything offensive off the shelves but it can be done. No one wether it be a child or adult needs to be filling their minds with those things. The world is a place full of good and bad things but you only want what is best for your child not what is going to harm them. I think we should try our best to get the things found most offensice off the shelves,8270,8271.0,Everyone opinion different things life wether seems important  I believe everyone rights  But must draw line somewhere appropreate  I believe offensive material removed shelves  Nobody wants see childs innocense taken away opening seeing picture book hearing bad word radio  Kids days learning things younger age  I personally know graders learned things songs shows nt know till much older  Parents role models play big role kids teens showing teaching shows watch watch music listen avoid  They must teach right wrong monitor child  So stay away things nt need learn hear  Everyone rights would difficult keep everything offensive shelves done  No one wether child adult needs filling minds things  The world place full good bad things want best child going harm  I think try best get things found offensice shelves
5625,2,"In a library there are books that can be considered offensive. There are books with violence, volger language, and bad pictures. Some books even have drugs and alcohol in it which isn't good for a child to see or read that kind of stuff. So is cencorship in libraries a good or bad idea? I think that there shouldn't be cencorship in libraries because if there was, there more than likely wouldn't be any books on the shelf at all in a library. Anybody could just come up and say I don't want my kid to see that book and the library would have to get rid of it. Also some parents are more strict and wouldn't want there kid to see something that another parent wouldn't mind if there child saw it. When I was younger, I was at a library with my mom. I walked away from her to go look at a book that cought my eye. When I went over there the cover of it looked really cool and interesting. When I started to read it it was about a mom that would do drugs and then beat her child. When I read it it kind of scared me then. My mom came over and snatched the book right out of my hands because she new it was a book a child shouldn't be reading. She was upset that I read that but she couldn't say anything to the library. After reading that it didn't change anything about my life or even effected me in anyway. Therefore, I don't think libraries should have to take books off there shelfs if someone wants them too. I don't think a library should have to take books off the shelves because there aren't that many books in a library that a child shouldn't be reading. Also the parent should be whatching there child so they don't get a bad book to read. In most kids lives there are worse stuff that has happened to them in there life then they will read in a book. Most parents use bad language around there child so if they see it in a book its not that big of a deal. Most libraries don't have that many books a child shouldn't be reading. But the books they do have that a child shouldn't be reading I think the best option would be too, have the library go through all the books. The books the library thinks a child shouldn't be reading they should take off the shelf. They should take all of them books and make a room for them that a child is not aloud to go in there unless the parent says it is ok for the child to go in there. Then the parent wouldn't have to worry about there child getting a book that has drugs, alcohol, and bad language in it. Also the library wouldn't have to worry about any parents getting mad if there child read a part of the book that there parents wouldn't want there child reading. Should a library have cencorship? Them were some of the reasons why i think a library shouldn't have to take books off a shelf if a parent wants them to.

Why do worry so much about when they are not involved with them? It doesn't matter if there is something you don't like on school or library shelves because you are not being forced to read it. Nobody is telling you that you have to believe in something. That information is there to help who want that information. If you don't want to read it, dont check it out. Find another book that you agree with, and let the person next to you read what they prefer. You will not always agree with the person sitting next to you, so you need to agree to disagree on some Let them read what they feel is interesting to them even though you dont see it fit for something.

Somebody found that offensive so they took it away from eveybody who was recieving help from it. What harm do i cause by silently reading the to myself? How could that be offensive to someone? By taking the away, I find that offensive, but since there is more who want it gone, they get what they want. have become so self demanding. If something isn't perfect in someone's mind, they will fight and fight until they get what they want. It doesnt matter to them if they are hurting along the way. It's all about them. That is what our world has come to today. Even if they have nothing to do with the topic they are trying to eliminate, they will never give up until the world is turning the way they please. need to realize that the world doesn't revolve around them! We need to stop being so demanding and hurtful. have the right to read and listen to what they like. Nobody can take away that right.

If only one person enjoys it, we should not take that from them. We do not have the right to steal someone's peace, happiness, or joy from them, even if we try. Leave on the shelves.

The curches banned book list started it all.The list made it forbidded to read the books published by and . The reason for censoring thease books was because they dissagreed what the said. Now even the church realizes that they were wrong in censoring the books. Today some parents and teacher want to censor libraies and make certian works unavalible to children. They point out that thease books have curse words, racial slurs, and homophobic remarks. Why do they not want children to hear thease words so they dont start saying them. The parents teach their children that curseing or useing slurs is wrong. This gets back to original reason for censorship. Like the parents don't want children to read thease books because the contridict what they say is right.Why can't parents admitt this is wrong like the did. Parents are concerend that their children will start useing thease words. As a high school student I can say that I had heard every curse word said around school before I read it in a book. This is not a problem that children know thease words.If you give the children the vocabulary they have to make the moral choice not to use thease words. Being able to make good choices is a major step in growing up. We all want children to grow up with a sense of morality. Parents fear that if children repeat words in books that have racial or homophobic remarks that their child will sound uneducated. Letting children read thease remarks is a form of education. Reading thease remarks children read how the felling for a certian group was back then. This should be use to show the change in mindset over the years. By letting childen see this we are just showing how the hate for thease groups is gone. Parents of censorship need to think of why they are doing this. Is it because they do not want to give the choice to their children to use thease words. Maybe they dont want them to learn the error of their ansestors ways. Maybe it is as simple as the books dissagree with what they teach their children.

Of course there is always gunna be that one person who posts or writes something inappropriate, but that goes along with it. However, most people can tell their story and not be weird about it. Every movie made in that i know of has a movie rating. It tells the viewer what kind of content is in the movie. Songs also have this rating process. Although the rating scale is different, it still informs the listener what is on the cd. Most of the time the covers of every item has a example of what is instore for you if you listen, watch, or read whatever it is. However like the old saying goes 'you can judge a book by is cover.' personal view is if the content is only suitable for mature adult audiences then they shouldnt make that kind of entertainment. Sure there be a sex scene in a movie but as long as they don't show any personal areas then the movie is okay. Books are educational at the least.

5630,2,"Offensive things should removed from libraries. The person incharge of the library should make the decision whether to keep or get rid of offensive things. Offensive things such as bad language or bad scenes from a movie can teach children bad things. Authors that write about offensive things can fix their books to make them not offensive to people. Then people will not make a big deal and books will not be pulled from the shelves. We children read something offensive from a book, they could use it somewhere like school. The child could then get in trouble for using a offensive term. If authors fixed this problem less problems will occur with people. Music contains many offensive terms. Music usually contains bad language. Artist that make music should edit the words they use so even little kids can hear it. They also need to leave out offensive words that can hurt someones feelings. People need to listen to music like good christian music. This contains good language and talks about our awesome Magazines can also have offensive things in it. Many magazines use offensive terms to describe famous people. The magazines try to make people look bad for things they did. Magazines can also have bad pictures. The pictures can contain some famous person you like doing something that isn't right. This can convince people to do something bad that could influence your life. In conclusion, I think we should get rid of offensive things in libraries.

5632,2,"Is People all over the world are sensitive when it comes to certain things. Some are more sensitive than others and can cause problems. That is when censorship is questioned, are there right amounts of censorship in public? When a person goes to the library there is one thing that everyone is there for, research of some sort. Whether it be for school, work, or pure interest, it does not matter. Books, magazines, movies and even are there for our benefit, yet there are some items that be seen as horrid and completly out of line in the library. brings the question: should these items be removed for their obscene facts? These items in fact should not be removed from shelves, for they are also there to teach. The library can be a place for teens and adults to get work done, it also can be a place where a little child learns about books and finds themself in a new world. is exactly why certain things are questioned for being on the shelves. There are certain topics in the world that are very senstive to other people whether it be because of race, sex, or religion, what the people must remember is that they have no complete control over what is discussed or brought up in public. They can however turn away from it and pretend it never was. When they go to the library though, they feel as if they should have the right to take everything they think harmful to society off of the shelves and all out together. is in fact not true, all they can do is tell their own children to turn away, but they can not get rid of it. Stated earlier, there are many topics that are out there that some people find too harsh to bring into the public, but what they do not realize is the fact that we can learn from these things. Eventhough there are things out there parents find wrong, we children and young adults need those things to help us with problems or situations we are in. For example, with teen pregnancy going up more in these years than in the past, parents feel like they must keep their teens away from all exposure to sex. Doing they ban television shows that seem to 'glamorize' what it is like to be a teen mom. In fact is completely false, a teen must get the real facts from where ever they can. Sometimes they have to get it from people around them, from people they knowe. Since a library is a place of learning they would be able to research things there, but if there are parents who take censorship to a new level then there will be some problems. If a parent were to go so far as to tell there teen to not learn about those things, then there is a greater chance of their teen being oblivious to what could happen. Doing probably will get them into a situation they could have avoided. That is why there should be censorship but not take things too far and pull things off the shelf. Another problem is that there are parents who are worried about the things that their teen or children run into at the library. They be curious about certain things and look up books that not be age appropriate. is one situation where a parent will want to take things off of the shelves, that way there is no temptation, no worry that thier children will be at risk. could be wrong because the parent would be taking away knowledge the teen need for later use. They feel like they are making things better in their life, when they are actually taking important things away. Censorship is a very serious topic that is always there. Some believe that things in the library are there for a reason, they are there for people to learn from, they are there to warn others about serious consequences. is why people should not be so insensitive and try to take action about taking the books out of the public. People should instead imbrace the fact that there will be certain things they will not agree with, and not try to take them away. They should realize that though they not be comfortable, there are others out there learning from",8286,8287.0,Is People world sensitive comes certain things  Some sensitive others cause problems  That censorship questioned  right amounts censorship public  When person goes library one thing everyone  research sort  Whether school  work  pure interest  matter  Books  magazines  movies even benefit  yet items seen horrid completly line library  brings question  items removed obscene facts  These items fact removed shelves  also teach  The library place teens adults get work done  also place little child learns books finds themself new world  exactly certain things questioned shelves  There certain topics world senstive people whether race  sex  religion  people must remember complete control discussed brought public  They however turn away pretend never  When go library though  feel right take everything think harmful society shelves together  fact true  tell children turn away  get rid  Stated earlier  many topics people find harsh bring public  realize fact learn things  Eventhough things parents find wrong  children young adults need things help us problems situations  For example  teen pregnancy going years past  parents feel like must keep teens away exposure sex  Doing ban television shows seem glamorize  like teen mom  In fact completely false  teen must get real facts ever  Sometimes get people around  people knowe  Since library place learning would able research things  parents take censorship new level problems  If parent go far tell teen learn things  greater chance teen oblivious could happen  Doing probably get situation could avoided  That censorship take things far pull things shelf  Another problem parents worried things teen children run library  They curious certain things look books age appropriate  one situation parent want take things shelves  way temptation  worry thier children risk  could wrong parent would taking away knowledge teen need later use  They feel like making things better life  actually taking important things away  Censorship serious topic always  Some believe things library reason  people learn  warn others serious consequences  people insensitive try take action taking books public  People instead imbrace fact certain things agree  try take away  They realize though comfortable  others learning

My oppinion is that we should let the parents decide. Growing up I wasn't allowed to watch scary movies or see anything my parents didn't want me to see. They believe that there is a certain maturity level you need to reach before you can fully understand things in life. Now that I have gotten older and seen some of the things my parents kept me away from I know why they did it and that most of the inappropriate things needed to be censored. of my friends and some of there parents just don't care. They have kids and decide they will just let them run wild and they will learn as they go, but this doesn't work. The problems I see in them as people originate from there childhood. Most of them would go to a library and get entertainment that was ment for adults or teens. I also think taht everything is fine without being censored because the parents are around to decide what the child can and can't get. I think that libraries should be censored but not over censored. The way they have libraries set up now is perfect for any problem that people have. No one wants there kid to read, listen to, or see anything that isn't fit for there age. If you keep the kids with the kids and the adults with the adults then everything will be ok. If we over censor the libraries then we could get rid of a lot of really good books, music, and magazines. For example twilight, one of the most popular book series and now movie series would be impossible for anyone to get because of some of the things that happen in them. We would get rid of a lot of artist that spread ther oppinons and lives through music such as, lady gaga, beyonce, taylor swift, and more. I love all of the entertainment the world has today and find most of it at my public library. It is your decision to make if you think that the libraries around you should be censored or not. I have reasons why they should or shouldnt be and I feel like they are the same for other people in different communities. Just sit back and think about it.

So therefore whatever they write can be written and published, but if it has certain types of literature it should be sold under warning or in an adult bookstore. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech. I really think that is a great writer and so do millions of others, you don't hear people talking bad about him. I'm simply suggesting that we separate our literature into genres. I feel that if we put books with certain language and grammar on shelves of stores that children can't get into maybe they wouldn't read it, unless their parents supervise. Like for instance, they are taking all of the old copies off the shelves and throwing them out because of the word nigger. I mean they are right, it is not a good word to use, but it is original in that book. Now it is going to be one of those refurbished copied craps. That upsets people, and some do not understand. I personally feel that if we take books off of shelves for good instead of distributing them from stores that have an age limit to enter, then there will be no books left out there that have good stories, and imagery. Alot of people like the grusome imagery of He will never be taken off the shelves for good, maybe from certain stores, but he will always be a legendary author.

5635,2,"Have you ever seen something offensive to you in a library? I have. I don't think it is right for libraries, where all age groups can go, to be selling this kind of things. For one, everyone should be treated equal, no one should have to go to a library and find offensive language/photographs of things, and it teaches younger childern bad things. I'm going to tell you about each one of these things a little more. First off, everyone in the should be treated equal. You shouldn't have to walk into a library and see/read about a white man calling a black man a rasist name. That shouldn't be allowed. That's not being treated equally. You should recieve the same amount of respect whether you are white, black, mexican, russian, ect., that's just not fair and it's down right disrespectful. You should be able to go to a library and be able to just relax and calm down instead of feeling unequal because you heard or read a rasist remark. Secondly, if you walk into a library and you see something you don't like, do you ever think you'll be going back in there? I wouldn't. No one should have to go to a library and find offensive language/photographs/movies of things. You should be able to walk into a library and find exactly what you're looking for without seeing something you don't appreciate. That's what makes places go out of bussiness. It should be removed. Finally, it teaches you're childern bad things. When your child learns a cuss word, or a rasist remark he/she had to of learned it from somewhere. You don't want it to be from a library. It shouldn't have to be from a library. Childern get in trouble for saying or drawing what they see or hear, but look at what people write about and make movies about and allow young childern read and view it. In conclusion, things like this need to be removed from a library. Libraries are a wonderful place to visit, but they won't get a lot of service if they see inapporiate/offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Everyone in this world needs to be treated equally, no one should have to go to a library and find offensive language/photographs of things, and it teaches young childern bad things. You're suppose to be taught right from wrong, but this kind of material teaches childern the opposite.

5636,2,"Everyone has different outlooks and opinions on things in life. Not everyone reads books for the same reason, and not everyone reads the same types of books either. If you were going to find a book at your local library for a report or just to read wouldn't you like to be able to find it. I do not think censorship should happen. I have many good reasons as to why I think that censorship is not good. To start off with most of the books that people think should be censorshipped are informational. Most people try to keep their kids sheltered from the real world now, but why? Maybe the reasons they do this is to make them not grow up so fast or even the fact that they do not want them to know about the possible bad things that could happen in life. So they think hiding this stuff from them is the best solution, well i strongly disagree with that. I think that the more knowledge you have of the good and bad things in the world regardless of if they apply to you or not make you a more successful person. My next reason for not approving censorship goes with the fact that most kids get their imaginations from reading all different kids of books. Whenever you were little most of us dream to be a princess or a fireman and everyone lives happily ever after. Then there might be kids who dream of other things. So why take away books that make them happy and can make some of there dreams half way fulfilled. My last point as to why I am not for this is simply, because everyone has to grow up at one point and books are not going to make that happen any faster. Yes i understand that most parents do not want their young daughters and sons to learn about the more complex things in life til a later age, but this day in age younger kids are doing worse things that older kids. Whenever I was younger i would have never thought about doing drugs or having a baby, but their are kids now that are doing both. I think the main reason that most younger kids are doing all of this is because they have not exacty been taught right from wrong, we were told that all of these things happening were terrible but now whenever a younger kids sees one of their friends doing these things and having no guidance from an adult thinks that it will be okay if I go out and do this just once. But in reality its not kids need to learn and books are how they learn about these things so why take away something that could save you from larger problems down the road. This is why I do not believe censorship is a good idea. It takes away from learning about society and everything else around you",8294,8295.0,Everyone different outlooks opinions things life  Not everyone reads books reason  everyone reads types books either  If going find book local library report read would nt like able find  I think censorship happen  I many good reasons I think censorship good  To start books people think censorshipped informational  Most people try keep kids sheltered real world   Maybe reasons make grow fast even fact want know possible bad things could happen life  So think hiding stuff best solution  well strongly disagree  I think knowledge good bad things world regardless apply make successful person  My next reason approving censorship goes fact kids get imaginations reading different kids books  Whenever little us dream princess fireman everyone lives happily ever  Then might kids dream things  So take away books make happy make dreams half way fulfilled  My last point I simply  everyone grow one point books going make happen faster  Yes understand parents want young daughters sons learn complex things life til later age  day age younger kids worse things older kids  Whenever I younger would never thought drugs baby  kids  I think main reason younger kids exacty taught right wrong  told things happening terrible whenever younger kids sees one friends things guidance adult thinks okay I go  But reality kids need learn books learn things take away something could save larger problems road  This I believe censorship good idea  It takes away learning society everything else around
5637,2,"Censorship in libraries is a violation of the and goes against everything the stands for. Freedom of the press is a vital liberty, and the is one of the best countries in protecting that right. But if we allow books or movies to be removed from shelves simply because they are found offensive, where do we stop? For those that complain and say that certain items are offensive, why do they look at those books? If they find something offensive, they should ignore it and do not let it bother them. If I believed that reading fiction books was a way to spread misinformation and I was offended by it, would the library simply take every fiction book off of its shelves to accomodate my feelings? No. Then why should certain books be deemed 'offensive' and removed from the shelves? It is my opinion that censorship should be removed from the shelves of our brains and not given another thought. These books, movies, and magazines are the product of someone's hard work and they do not deserve to be thrown away as trash. Every human being is unique and sees the world from their own point of view, and our intrinsic values give everyone the chance to voice their opinion. Censorship is effectively telling those people that, because their viewpoints not be socially acceptable, they do not deserve to be heard, and I think that trods on everything stands for. In conclusion, censorship not only hurts image as 'the land of the free', but stifles the creativity of every person that does not believe their point of view is worth writing about.

5638,2,"This persuasive essay is about my views on the censorship in the libraries. The question is do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines and more should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. My answer to the question is yes. Why? The reason for my thoughts is because its offensive. It can cause problems and also could show the library has no concerns of anyone feelings. Another reason is because someone could sue the library if others are offended by the books, music, movies and magazines. Besides we as a people have the rigth to remove anything if we feel it is offensive to us. My first reason was because it was offensive . Why? An example is because its not being fair with the others' feelings. What gives them the right to display anything that hurts your feeling! Why should you have to go to a library to check out a book at anytime and see somthing offensive everytime you go there! A library is there for you to enjoy and feel comfortable. If the point of a library was to display harmful images or remark there would'nt be anyone there. A library shouldn't want to hurt or offend anyone its there to spread joy and enhance your knowledge. Another reason, was because a person could sue the library if others' are offended by the books, music, movies, and magazines. If you have enough people offended by the library take it to court if they don't get rid of it. It wouldn't be fair if you have seventy-five percent or more offended by what the display . If the library still displays it don't go there anymore. They would change their minds and get rid of what offense you and others. We as a people control the library without us there is no such place as a library. When we go there its their job to make sure everything is to your liking . The library has no reason to upset anyone. A library is a quiet learning place for you to get a peace of mind if anything else contact someone to address the problem. No library should enhance bad remarks, posters, or anything of that sort of things that displays danger to you or anyone else.A nything that slander you take it up in court again. In conclusion, my choice is they should remove things that offend the people . A library has no right to display thing that offend anyone. A person could sue and shut a library down if they have enough evidence to to support their reasons. A library again is there to enhance your knowlege, reading and more.

5639,2,"first of all, whos to what is offensive? its only offensive if you portrea it that way. if you would like there to be no material that would offend you then simply dont think of the material as meaning harm or offense. saying this i beleive there should be no censorship due to the fact that it is unconstituntional to just say you dont have the freedom to write what you want just because it might hurt the feelings of another person. no matter what you write it will probably offend somebody somewhere. but that is only because that person has a scewed point of view on the topic. this happens because the reader takes things too personaly. this is typical because the average human is selfish and this too much about how everything affects them. i think authors should have the ability to publish anything they want into a public library. but too make everyone happy maybe the author could give a breif summary about the topic he or she is talking about in the material they are producing on the book or magazine somewhere for the reader to see. in conclusion i think that people need to not worry about how material that is being posted in the media affects them. also the writer should not be cencored on his or her beleifs. that is my view on the topic and it will not change. and because of my view i have never read something i wouldnt want my children or any other child reading",8300,8301.0,first  whos offensive  offensive portrea way  would like material would offend simply dont think material meaning harm offense  saying beleive censorship due fact unconstituntional say dont freedom write want might hurt feelings another person  matter write probably offend somebody somewhere  person scewed point view topic  happens reader takes things personaly  typical average human selfish much everything affects  think authors ability publish anything want public library  make everyone happy maybe author could give breif summary topic talking material producing book magazine somewhere reader see  conclusion think people need worry material posted media affects  also writer cencored beleifs  view topic change  view never read something wouldnt want children child reading

While it is nessecary to make some perhaps available to only certain ages, banning books flat out is just stupid. Like '@CAPS1 many bookd have been removed or attempted to be removed from circulation. Coincidently, many of the now famous books we read today were once hated and removed from shelfs all across To let a good book be throw away and forgotten just because it mentions a different religion or a different point of view is not a good reason. How are we to know if its a good book if we are not allowed to read it? How can a book be properly assessed if we are blinded by our current beliefs? If some people had their way the only thing avaliable in school libraries would be the of course then others would hate the and demand it be removed. So then whats the point of having the library to begin with? For every book there is going to be someone who hates it ands to get rid of it, and if one person is allowed to remove a book then everyone else should have the same right, which very well end with only Suess left on library shelves. While some of the more mature books need to be restricted to only certain ages, no book should ever be banned from libraries.

5642,2,"Have you ever been offended or hurt from something said in books, magazines, music, or movies? Dont worry, a lot of people do. It is very common to feel hurt by the words or actions within those. Some people take it more to heart than others, and that is ok as well. What many people wonder is why do companies and businesses allow those types of books, magazines, music, and movies to be out on the shelves to be sold? Is there something someone can do to help censor them? Those are two wonderful questions that come upon many people's minds. Surprisingly, people have tried to get those horrible, offensive things off the shelves before. Sometimes, depending on the quality of the material, they are taken off the shelves. The problem with taking all of the offensive things off shelves is that all people have their own level of offense, this meaning that what be offensive to one person, not be to another. It is very difficult to choose what types of material are on the extreme levels of offense, so that is why it is hard to choose which materials should be taken off shelves for it. In my personal opinion, I dont think that the material in books, magezines, and things like that are very important. I believe that people can be mature and be able to handle the sorts of material within them. People today take offense way to easily within media and entertainment. I do understand how people can take certain things to heart, but what they have to understand is that it is also someone else's opinion and thoughts, and that someone might be offended by your thoughts and opinions as well. Although I believe people should be able to handle some of the material within books and magezines, I also believe that those types of things should not be put in a place where it is inappropriate. For example, a playboy magezine should not be sold or put on a shelf in a children's library or bookstore. It is extremely obvious that underaged children should not be exposed to that sort of material. So, I think that the location of these types of material play a strong role as to whether it is necessary or appropriate. Overall, it is very difficult to make a decision whether certain books, magezines, movies,or music should be taken off shelves because of their offensive material. It is much easier to cope with this problem if people would stand back and look at things through a different perspective, by understanding that offense was not intended and that it is just simply the thoughts and opinions of another human being. One thing that I do recommend to owners and businesses that contain this material is to make sure it is appropriate, given the people it is sold to and the places it is held",8306,8307.0,Have ever offended hurt something said books  magazines  music  movies  Dont worry  lot people  It common feel hurt words actions within  Some people take heart others  ok well  What many people wonder companies businesses allow types books  magazines  music  movies shelves sold  Is something someone help censor  Those two wonderful questions come upon many people s minds  Surprisingly  people tried get horrible  offensive things shelves  Sometimes  depending quality material  taken shelves  The problem taking offensive things shelves people level offense  meaning offensive one person  another  It difficult choose types material extreme levels offense  hard choose materials taken shelves  In personal opinion  I dont think material books  magezines  things like important  I believe people mature able handle sorts material within  People today take offense way easily within media entertainment  I understand people take certain things heart  understand also someone else s opinion thoughts  someone might offended thoughts opinions well  Although I believe people able handle material within books magezines  I also believe types things put place inappropriate  For example  playboy magezine sold put shelf children s library bookstore  It extremely obvious underaged children exposed sort material  So  I think location types material play strong role whether necessary appropriate  Overall  difficult make decision whether certain books  magezines  movies  music taken shelves offensive material  It much easier cope problem people would stand back look things different perspective  understanding offense intended simply thoughts opinions another human  One thing I recommend owners businesses contain material make sure appropriate  given people sold places held
5643,2,"Offence is in the eyes of the beholder. Different people find different things to be offencive, but everyone will find something offencive in thier lives at some point in time. Just because the mother of a five year old doesn't want her child reading a book series such as a series filled with swearing, death, killing, and sexual induendos, doesn't mean that noone should be able to read these books. If libraries cencored all work that someone found offencive there would be next to nothing left on the shelves, just for the fact that almost anything recorded or writen will offend someone at some point in time. People live with offence everyday and what some people find offencive is not what others take offence to, if people are offended something then those people should just not read it, and if they don't want their children to read it then they can keep it from thier children, but they have no right to take it away from everyone else. In my readings I have read many offencive and abrasive things, but to some they are not offencive. One key book that comes to mind is 'To a In this book black people are often refered to a word that in todays' society is not correct to say but in the society that it was written in the words they used were used on a daily baisis. Some modern readers find this material to be offencive, but the reason that they do is because it's frowed upon todays society when in all reality all that it is is our history. Another book series that people often take offencivly is called '@CAPS4 Materials' and includes the books 'The 'The and 'The In this series the government is trying to find and destroy a higher power, comparable to the modern day of This book is very contriverical and full of killing swearing and other things that are very taboo for todays day and age. One of the biggest taboos in this book is the fact that they look at religion in a light that the church doesnt really like, but at the same time it's bringing religion into the picture so seperation of church and state makes it so that many schools wont keep it. One more highly contriverical book I have read was 'The This book is a story of a mans trip to and through while being led a counciler named takes a very odd veiw on and describes punishments that people should face for thier sins, such as burning eternaly, drowning, being frozen broken and put back togther and so on. This book is not right for a five year old to read, but overprotective parents and a government should not take that right away from those of us who could actually take something from these books. These books, and alot of books for that matter, are full of contrivercy, anger, and a lot of parents don't want thier children reading them. Alot of these parents don't want thier children to read them because they are afraid of offence. As soon as someone says something offencive parents and teachers go on the defencive. They don't want anyone to ever be offended because if they are then they get sad. I'm speaking melodramaticly of course but the point im trying to make is the fact that parents and schools are trying to protect thier kids to the point of smothering them. Schools complain about reading scores being so low, but its a wonder why they are when they take away half of the books worth reading because someone took some sort of offence to it.

5644,2,"Do I believe that certain materials should be taking from the shelf? My ansewer to that question is no. My reason for that answer is because of the money they need to make, some people like it, and I think that people have the right to sell there materials on the selves. If materials is taken off the shelf and is not being sold then the authors, artist, movie producers, etc is not making any money and if they are not making any money then they can not support their house holds and there family. If someone write a book and want it published then I think they have the right because if they write a book then they might have something to say and want people to listen. In the world we live in now we need money to survive because there is too many things we need to live and they are not free and if the materials are taken off the shelf and is not sold then they can not make money. Everyone has there own opinion about things. If someone don't like the material dont mean someone else don't like it so therefore I don't think it should be taken off the self and not be sold. I think that if someone find it offensive then you shold not buy it at all because someone else like it. And if it is not suitable for children then put a age limit on it so that children could not buy it only a adult. If you were in the shoes of those who are trying to make money would you want your item taken off the self I dont think so. People have the right to make music, write books, make movies, etc and sell them. If people dont want to buy them then thats there problem. I dont think that it should be taken off the self because someone thinks its offensive that is not a a good reason to cut off someone blessings and not let them make there money.

5645,2,"Would you want to see something lying upon a shelf that was offensive to you? Would you feel embarassed if someone nearby picked it up and read it, as you watched? Materials such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed if they're offensive. Many reading materials can be taken offensively in many ways. They contain words that hurt people or describe something in a way that could be incorrectlty interpreted. For instance, if an woman was reading a magazine and it used racial turns, she would be offended. Do you think this woman would want to replace the magizine back on the shelf that had just hurt her feelings? No, instead she would want to report it or simple just throw it away. Music, in today's society, can be very crude. Many musicians don't care about what they're actually singing or writing about. What they care most about is money. Whether the lyrics of a song are rude or not and as long as they're getting paid, they'll more than likely put out that song. A lot of music now is somehow related to drugs, alcohol, and contains many curse words. All offensive music can't be eliminated, but it shouldn't be so freely played. If a mother of small children turns on the radio and it's playing a bad song, it could teach the children to say and do corrupted things. A parent can't watch their child's every move and can't protect them from everything. Movies have many violent scenes, curse words, and inappropriate actions. If a child views a movie like such, it give them ideas or could lead to them following exactly as they had seen the actors do. Children have people whom they look up to. It doesn't help when a actor, musician, or author gets into trouble, arrested, or accused of a crime. It simply influences a child to be like their 'hero'. It also doesn't help when channels like and use these people are 'special guest' on shows. Overall today's books, music, movies, and magizines aren't teaching, but filling people's heads with negative thoughts and leading them to do violent things. However, not every bad things can be blocked out or locked away, it would help if people tried to make them less offensive",8312,8313.0,Would want see something lying upon shelf offensive  Would feel embarassed someone nearby picked read  watched  Materials books  music  movies  magazines removed re offensive  Many reading materials taken offensively many ways  They contain words hurt people describe something way could incorrectlty interpreted  For instance  woman reading magazine used racial turns  would offended  Do think woman would want replace magizine back shelf hurt feelings  No  instead would want report simple throw away  Music  today s society  crude  Many musicians nt care re actually singing writing  What care money  Whether lyrics song rude long re getting paid  ll likely put song  A lot music somehow related drugs  alcohol  contains many curse words  All offensive music ca nt eliminated  nt freely played  If mother small children turns radio s playing bad song  could teach children say corrupted things  A parent ca nt watch child s every move ca nt protect everything  Movies many violent scenes  curse words  inappropriate actions  If child views movie like  give ideas could lead following exactly seen actors  Children people look  It nt help actor  musician  author gets trouble  arrested  accused crime  It simply influences child like hero   It also nt help channels like use people special guest  shows  Overall today s books  music  movies  magizines nt teaching  filling people s heads negative thoughts leading violent things  However  every bad things blocked locked away  would help people tried make less offensive
5646,2,"The problem in here is that some people get offensive when they see wrong books. They sometimes put offensive books in the library tbnat are not offensive to them but they are to other people. They has been a lot of problems because they had made books that are not really nice to other people but the library thinks that they are books that won't affect people that much. I think that libraries should not do censorship cause I think people have the right to read what they wan't. If the books are really offensive that they would just affect the people then they should just take it out of the shelf. There has been books published in the library that people think that they are not nice to be in there. There some books about politics that some people found offensive. People think that when they put politics books they are offending some people and the libraries have a lot of this kind of books. I don't really think that this books should be remove from one reason because some people enjoy reading books about politics and they learn about them and other people think that they are not intersting and they are some kind offensive. They are a lot of books about racism in the libraries that people think they are offensive but some people think that they are nice because they teach you a lesson about racism and things that are best and that you should never offend somebody just because they are from another country. Another book that people thought that was offensive was the Of book. People thought they were trying to offend some poeple with that book. They also have books about that some people found offensive. This books should be removed for some reasons but they should keep them from other reasons. In some other countries they found other things that are offensive but that they are not offensive in other countries. When people go visit a country and they go to a library and they see some books they might think that they are offensive to them and they just think that it shouldn't be there. In they found the bible offensive but in here we don't find it offensive. I have seen some people that read a book and they just think that they are mean and offensive and they just said what do they have this kind of books in here. Other poeple think that they are entertaining and fun and they just enjoy it. I had read things that I found offensive and I just think why do they have them in here I just think that they should be removed. I have seen movies that have some parts that they are not really nice and that they are offending some people from different cultures. They are fun to watch and they are intertaining and they are fuuny. There movies that you watch and you just enjoy them and you think that they are funny and that it's a good movie. Some people think that they are offensive and they just think why do they make this kind of movie and that just feel offended from the movie while other people thought it was a good movie and that it was fuuny. Poeple have different opinions about things movies, books, magazines and things. I think that libraries should not censorship people. I also think that they should not put books, movies, magazines or other things that are too offensive to some people. If they are somewhat offensive they should just keep the book in the shelf but if they are things that people just can handle them then they should consider to take them off so people feel better and that they don't feel offended.

5647,2,"Books sometimes have offensive terms or things that just are offensive period but is it really enough to have a book tooking of the shelves of a library. Many other items in the the library that people find to have offensive terms in is music,movies, and magazines.Some of the books that many libraries have tooken of the selves be the books that actually is the most educational books for us even though theres some not so right things in theses books. Many important books in the world have many offensive things in their book but most books like that many people still like to read and they actually learn something from it. Books,magazines, or another items in the library are good resources for anybody if theres some offensive things in the book i do not think they should be removed off the shevles because them same offensive things could teach us about something in life. Many libraries in schools remove books that have offensive things to some people but all people might not think that them same books are offensive. School libraries have taken out many important books out of the library that could teach us important lessons in life. Often many books or magazines are taken off the shelves because of cursing.Cursing might be offensive to some people but to many other people they feel like they could relate to some of the things that character or person was going through. Even some of the most important people in the world have had some their books tooken out the library because of some offensive things. There have been many books removed from the shelves of the libraries but most of theses books were removed just because one person founded the book offensive. Many different people love to read books by but some people feel what she say is offensive but really her books teach many people different things. Libraries felt her books were offensive but really her books told her personal experience of life and some people felt it to offensive but really it was not and it should not been removed from the library shelves. The more books i read the more i see that many of theses stories that i read maybe offensive but it really showed me that you learn something from bad things instead of good things. Different items in the library makes it more fun to read. If their were more offensive items in the library i think people would read more. Just because that person who might get offensive about that item might actually learn something from that same bad thing. Books or anything else should never be removed from any library self because many items in the library are there for a reason and purpose and it might be offensive to one person but it could be good for somebody else.Everything on the shelves of a library do not have to please everybody just because it might offensive some do not mean its not good for somebody else.

5648,2,"Libraries are removing certain material from their shelves that they find offensive. Although the main thought and reason for this action is commendable, Libraries should not have the authority to censor certain information. People have the right to think for themselves, and make decisions for themselves. is a violation to take away the 'bad', because we still deserve to choose to know about the 'bad'. An excellent example of this affecting a large population would be the government blocking various websites in mainland The government blocks websites such as youtube, facebook, and more to cover up the massacre that is happening in All kinds of articles and tv reports that speak the truth about what is really happening is completely blocked out, so that the people do not know the truth. Although this case is somehwat different from censorship of 'offensive' material in libraries, is also similar in the way that they are taking away the right of choosing to know certain information. Some people say: 'But what about the children who should be protected from certain harmful information?' is the parents' job to choose what information their child sees or hears, not the library's. The libraries still have the responsibility of presenting all the information that is out there. Furthermore, 'offensive' material is positive in different ways. provides an alternative outlook and challenges you to think about what is right, helping you to think on your own two feet. can also push people to strive for what is 'good'. Certain kinds of 'offensive' material is essential in life. Like for instance, an article about rape or murder, information that some people not want their children to know about, would make you become more aware and cautious of the real world, of what could happen to anyone. Think of how oblivious we would be of what is happening in the real world if we did not have the information. There truly are some offensive and vulgar things in this world.

5649,2,"I partly agree with this quotation. There does need to be censorship, but you can not censor and protect your children from every single thing that you would find offensive or wouldn't want them to see. We can't have totally gory or adult style books in a midddle school library for example. Young minds should not be exposed to such things for many years to come. Another thing that must be watched out for is rascisim in books. This I believe does not belong in books untill at least high school level, and should only be included for educational values. There is however another side to the story. If we are to censor books, then we can't go on a mad spree and take of books from all libraries nation wide. There needs to be equal sacrifice on both ends. To parents your kids are going to witness, hear and see some things your would prefer them not to, but that is just part of parenting. You can't shelter them forever. Now to the writers/screeners, you can't go over the top with your books. There has to be another way to get your point accross, and tell your story without killing an entire nation, or whiping out a whole ethnic group in the process. In conclusion there must be scarifice on both ends. Partly with parents, and also with the writters.

5650,2,"Censorship in Libraries should and shouldn't be allowed depending on the location of the library. Libraries in schools should take out content that is uneeded because, could be offensive to the students. If is a public libray, I believe explicit content should be allowed because, shows truth. Public Libraries should allow books that are raw because, they have the right to,and not everyone has to read those books. If someone believes a book is offenesive because, of their beliefs then they should not read Libraries do not force people to read books that have crude language or that could be graphic is the freedom of the person to chose what books he/she wants to read. However, if was unknown to them that harsh content was within the book then is also their fault because, they still picked that book. School libraries should not allow books with very violent situations becuase, could influence the student body's mentality. If they allow the violence at least warn students beforehand ,so they can prepare their mindset. Some histroical books like are even being rewrote to make people happy even though, is a classic piece of historical literature and contains only one word that sets people off. Rewriting a whole book for just one little word is kind of extreme and is kind of ridiculous. All does shows truth, history, and a classic tale of the past and all because, was not censored. Censoring will ruin that historical image ,but school liberies will still carry legacy on. Public libraries; however, feature many titles and are not only for students ,but everyone. They divide their library into sections and is better fit for explicit content. Libraties that are public should speak the truth about history and should leave nothing out. At public libraries you have the freedom to pick the book of your choice, so if you don't want a book with content that is questionable do not pick up. This statement is not only true at public libraries ,but anyplace that has books even a bookstore. If people do not like to read offensive content they should just ignore cause is not going away anytime soon. The only time you are asigned a book is in class. If their is specific content that could potentially be offensive ,then the teacher usually gives out a permission slip ,so the student chose if he/she wants to read the book. Censorship is an element that blinds the truth and takes away from books ,and should only be used when needed in violent graphic situations.

5651,2,"All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. Most parents would agree that they would not want their children to look, or listen to certian books or music. It is their responsibility as parent to protect them from the things that they do not want them to see. You also have the people who are plenty old enough to make their own desisions and have the right to read what ever they choose. If you took out all of the books that are offensive or voulger then what would we have left to read. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a good point. There are many books that might be offensive to many people. Say for example a white male is offended by what is said about white people in a book about people, and yet someone else might need that book as a reference to write a paper on whites and This one person be offended but you can't take a book just because one person be offended. Music is also very conterversial with the way it is presented in the world we live in. Again though you can't take out one genre of music just because another group doesn't like it. I love all kinds of music. I like country, christian, pop, and pretty much most everything. One I don't really like is rap music. Some is all right but most of it I don't really appreciate that much. Thing is I'm not going to want to take it out because some one else would not like that, just the same if some one took out for say music. So you see you can't take out all the offensive stuff because everyone can be offended in their own way. Then there would be no books, magazines, even no music.

Libraries should make their own system to know what book to take out and when to do it. I believe that if one person finds a book offensive it is only one person. If more than one person finds the book offensive it should be taken out. Many people are not going to say any thing to the library so the librarians won't know if people think the books is offinsive or not. That is why censorship in libraries is contraversial. Many people like some things and others don't. Some people will speak up and others won't. Katherine Paterson a author said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' That is why each library should set up their own system for the people that come to their library. In the censorship of libraries it is not always agreede on.

There is no reason for there to be any offensive books in the library, but if that is how somone feels then there is really nothing you could do about it. the only thing I would know to do is not put them on the shelf.There is a part in me that says its okay, but also one that says no. There are multiple reasons why it wouldn't be okay but the main one would have to be to not make the customers upset. Say an boy walked in and he seen a racist book something along those lines, then he isn't going to want to come back to the Then there are cases where someone freaks out over the littlest thing and gets mad over something really stupid, then there is really no reason to take it off the shelf. Once you start donig that then you wouldn''t even have a book anymore. You would find something wrong with every little book then in a week is like, 'oh wow i have no books left.' would not be good at all. Like said in her quote, 'then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So I think that I lean more towards the line of if it offends you, you don't have to read it just move on and find a book that fits you. If there is something in a that you don't want your children to see then don't take them in that at all and take them to a childrens You can find all types of ways to get around it if you don't want them to see what is in there. You don't have to casue a big scene and make the owner get read of something that the next person with out a kid in the house would want. The only personal experince I have had of was when my family and I went into a Book in and we were looking around and man and his daughter was next us in the Well his daughter picked up a book and he freaked out becasue it was a sexual reproduction book. He was very mad but got over it really quick. So that helps me to say that you wouldn't have to take book off the shelf. So after saying all of my main conclusion is that you don't have to take those books off the shelf unless you get alot of complains about it. Most people would just walk on by n\and not say much about it. So all in all make sure nothing is to bad and it will all be okay in the end, you won't have to worry about aking books off of your shelf.",8330,8331.0,topic half half  There reason offensive books library  somone feels really nothing could  thing I would know put shelfThere part says okay  also one says  There multiple reasons would nt okay main one would make customers upset  Say boy walked seen racist book something along lines  nt going want come back Then cases someone freaks littlest thing gets mad something really stupid  really reason take shelf  Once start donig  even book anymore  You would find something wrong every little book week like  oh wow books left   would good  Like said quote  then books left shelf us   So I think I lean towards line offends  nt read move find book fits  If something nt want children see nt take take childrens You find types ways get around nt want see  You nt casue big scene make owner get read something next person kid house would want  The personal experince I family I went Book looking around man daughter next us Well daughter picked book freaked becasue sexual reproduction book  He mad got really quick  So helps say would nt take book shelf  So saying main conclusion nt take books shelf unless get alot complains  Most people would walk nand say much  So make sure nothing bad okay end  wo nt worry aking books shelf 
5655,2,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that the librarys should not be using censorship in there librarys. I think that everyone should get a chance to enjoy the thoughts and veiws of others through books, music, ect. Just because one group of people believe that a book is offensive doesnt mean somebody else will. In my oppinion thats taking away one of our freedoms as a people. If you can take away the right to read any book, magazine, of any other thing what makes you think they wont start takeing more. Like with the society because of all the censorship their they couldnt possible know anything about the outside world. There are other places in the world where you would need specific jobs to be able to watch or read a certian kind of book, or watch a certain type of news station. When you start takeing away small things like what you can or cant read. People might get the idea to take away whatever you dont want them to know or have. Its a possibilty that one day we wont even get to know whats in the news. It could probably get worse from there. There probably are other things like what happens to the people who get to know all this stuff they might get a little to excited and tell someone about something they saw or read. Both of the people could get hurt then. Laws should pervent cencorship in places such as the library because its everyones right to have an oppinion just as much as it is for everyone to pick up a book and read it.

5656,2,"Should Books Be Removed From Shelves? Many people believe that libraries do not have any offensive books or magazines, etc. But what people don't know is that some people might think a book or magazine is offensive and some not. Children are allowed to read whatever they want, but does that mean that those books they are reading need to be taken off the shelf? People who take certain books, magazines, movies, etc. offensive then they need to start reading the back of the covers. The cover will tell you what the plot, setting, and foreshadows things that happen. Don't get a book just because the name sounds good, then it turns out that the book isn't what you espected at all. Parents if your child is reading something that you take offensive and they don't, do not assume that you need to down to the library and tell them to remove the book. Children have different tastes in books unlike their parents. No one wants books, magazines or movies taken off the shelves, just because someone takes it offensive or is too lazy to read the back and it's not what they expected. Parents do need to watch what their child is reading and watching but don't be watching them like a hawk. Magazines, books and movies do have both a positive and a negative influence on children, young adults and adults. A movie that your child is watching have a negative influence on them doesn't mean that it was the library's fault for them checking it out and them watching it. Yes, the librarian should have asked or made sure that they were a certain age for them to check it out, but they also need to be mature about those kinds of things. Children can't think that what people in movies do, they can do it too. That's not the way our society works. No one wants their favorite book, magazine or movie taken off the shelf just because someone takes it offensively. We all need to start reading the inside or back of covers to make sure that this is something that you would enjoy reading or watching.

5657,2,"Every parent wants to protect their children from inapproiate material. Everyone knows this is impossible to do given our environment. In this world we live in there is only so much a parent can do to keep their child with a good state of mind. Libraries are the one place parents want their child at. Now days, eveything revolves around technology. If a child want to read a book, they can simply look one up on the internet. The internet has tons of books and information pertaining to books. In the world we live in you rarely find a child willing to, if not forced to, going to a library. Back in the old days, when things were not so technical, you could not find a kid that would not be in the library. The library was a good source of books, computers, movies, music, magazines, and more. I think libraries should not have books, movies, and magazines, that are in anyway offensive. The library is one of the few rare places, where kids can go and expect not to run into anything offensive. If your kid is going to a library, the only thing that should be on their mind are books. So as a parent, you would hope there will be only helpful, clean books for your child. I had a friend who once went into a library and checked out a 'dirty' magazine. He took the magazine and showed all his friends. So now not only is his mind flithy, but so is his friends. This is not fair to parents at all. It is hard enough to keep children away from 'dirty' televison shows and music, but now they have to watch out for the libraries, too? Music is a big influence on the kids of A big percent of music is sending a bad message amoung children. If a kid wanted to buy a cd that their parents would not approve of, they can just got to the library to get it. I, for one, would not want my child to listen to music that will encourage him to not go to college, use derrogative language, or treat others badly. Once again, they can disobey my orders and go to the library to get it. Children can be very sneaky at times. I once saw a ten year old boy, walk out a library with a pornographic movie in his hand. The next day, I saw the same little boy in the newsapaper. He got caught having sex with a little girl inside of a car! When asked what was he doing, he said he saw it in a movie he just checked out from the library. His parents were distraught and tried to take their case to court. But, in the end, they lost the case because the library said, the boy's parents should have been monitoring him. In my closing, getting rid of offensive material in libraries will only help brighten up childrens' minds. This would also help reassure to parents, that the library is once again a safe clean place to go. The library can make such a big impact on a child's life, so why not ge rid of anything that will put filth on their mind? Childrens' minds are easily influenced by what we put around them. The children are the future for us, so why not help them in every way possible. We can start by getting rid of all things offensive in our libraries.",8336,8337.0,Every parent wants protect children inapproiate material  Everyone knows impossible given environment  In world live much parent keep child good state mind  Libraries one place parents want child  Now days  eveything revolves around technology  If child want read book  simply look one internet  The internet tons books information pertaining books  In world live rarely find child willing  forced  going library  Back old days  things technical  could find kid would library  The library good source books  computers  movies  music  magazines   I think libraries books  movies  magazines  anyway offensive  The library one rare places  kids go expect run anything offensive  If kid going library  thing mind books  So parent  would hope helpful  clean books child  I friend went library checked dirty  magazine  He took magazine showed friends  So mind flithy  friends  This fair parents  It hard enough keep children away dirty  televison shows music  watch libraries   Music big influence kids A big percent music sending bad message amoung children  If kid wanted buy cd parents would approve  got library get  I  one  would want child listen music encourage go college  use derrogative language  treat others badly  Once  disobey orders go library get  Children sneaky times  I saw ten year old boy  walk library pornographic movie hand  The next day  I saw little boy newsapaper  He got caught sex little girl inside car  When asked  said saw movie checked library  His parents distraught tried take case court  But  end  lost case library said  boy s parents monitoring  In closing  getting rid offensive material libraries help brighten childrens  minds  This would also help reassure parents  library safe clean place go  The library make big impact child s life  ge rid anything put filth mind  Childrens  minds easily influenced put around  The children future us  help every way possible  We start getting rid things offensive libraries 
5658,2,"I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves of a library, if they are found offensive. Most schools should not have these haughty and profantity-filled books, etc. in their shelves. Most students nowadays don't have many positive role models. They're constantly being ridiculed and pressured to act a certain way, dress a certain way, etc. Too many movies, music videos, and shows are showing young people that it's okay to wear smaller clothes and look just like those people on I've read plenty of articles in magazines that most young people should not be reading. I've seen girls trying to dress like '@CAPS3 '@CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'. I've seen boys trying to be the next '@PERSON3', '@CAPS6 and '@PERSON2.' will this change? Too many people in this generation are having an 'anything goes' attitude towards everything. The common argument 'everyone is doing it' is just an excuse for those who want to do something, but don't want to do it alone. Censorship should definitely be used in this respect, because if there's more positive books and positive role models, children and teenagers won't act as rebellious as they do now. On most magazine headlines, they're always talking about the bad going on in society. Hardly ever do you hear good things that people do. Somebody that I think is very inspirational is She has helped so many people get to the place where they are today. Besides her television show, you don't really hear much about her in the magazines, because most people don't want to hear about it. They'd much rather hear about 'who slept with who' and 'who killed who's husband'. It just isn't right. If all young adults and parents took a stand in this big issue, it could really save a lot of issues. I've seen people walking around only being a year or two older than me, pregnant. It scares me to know that our generation has gotten to that. Most books I've checked out of my school library have profanity, drama, pregnancies, sex, abuse, etc. At this age in time, nobody ever really reads things that have anything to do with helping society. Nobody is strong enough to take a stand and talk to people about changing the way our society is now. Back in nobody would even think of getting pregnant so early, especially unmarried. Nobody would want to read material like the ones we read now. Back then, it was a privelege to be able to read. Now, everyone takes for granted what we DO have access to in People are starving in while we are spending billion+, just on electronics and things that we really don't need. In it was a privelege just to have Everyone wants more and more and more. They won't stop until they get what they want. Children and teenagers should not have access to all the things we have now. The libraries are basically giving us freedom to do these things. By reading this in our books, we feel that if our favorite character can do it, so can we. There has to be a change. Someone has to be strong enough to come forth. This isn't right and censorship should be used more often. Libraries need to take a stand and censor what their recipients are watching, listening to, and reading.

5659,2,"When I was kid I went to libraries with my mom, and rented books that I thought looked interesting. I never thought wether the book was offensive to some people or not. The book I happened to choose, was about an boy who worked as a slave for his whole lofe, and right after he passed away of getting beat to death slavery ended. He never got the chance to go to school, play with friends, or just sit down. Very many people would take this book the wrong way. They might say it brings back memories to children who's ancestors were slaves. Wether or not that book makes other people or children despise it, it made me realize the dramatic trama the went through and still go through today. If a book can make a boy at the age of years old think and realize that, then books, movies, or magazines like '@CAPS5 should stay.

5660,2,"The editor of this newspaper, I believe that libraries should have certian content in their own section of the library. Some people find it offencing that anyone can remove a book from the shelf that shouldn't be seen by their eyes. Little kids like going to the library to read about fairy tailes, and about dragons and monsters, not books that have explicit content. They shouldn't have the chance to be exposed to content that even adults don't want to see. I feel like no matter where you look you can see explict content anywhere.

5661,2,"This even go public, In some states because what if a book gets removed off of a shelf, some collage kid need to use for a book report. And they not have the propper books for there paper or project that they have to finish for school. I think that censoryship is a good thing, because there are some things that kids should not see, because some of that stuff can teach them to do bad things. People think it is wrong to be taking books off of the shelf in libraries but I think that it is a good thing that they are doing this. One person think one book is bad for a kid but the other think that it is something they need to know, but there are somethings that kids should learn at a certin age. Now onto magazines, Magazines are an okay thing but sometimes there a lot of things that can be miss read and people can call and complain about things that they miss read. But I agree with some stuff that people say about magazines, 'why,' personly I think that we need to chill out on the things that writers write about and then we go and blow up on writers because they said one thing about another person and then it will get a big fight going around and soon you know it, it will be around the world. There are some movies that are okay for little kids and there are some that are not okay for them either, but you have parents that think it is okay for there little kids to watch ratted movies. the thing is that you shouldn't let your kids watch them, like I have already said in this artcail it can teach them to do bad things that parents would not want them to do but you can not stop your childeren from doing the things they want. They will find a way to get out and do what they please. Another big thing is music, music be good to lsten to but it does have an effect on people. I personly believe that if you are going to do something do not do anything stupid and get caught for it because you can end up getting in a lot of trouble that you would not want to get into. I have to say one more thing about all of this, try to keep it to your self and worry about your own self and not everybody else.

5662,2,"katherine paterson brings a very good point to our attention, the right to remove an offensive book from the shelf but is it really offensive or historic? I belive that all the books that are in our libraries ar stricly professional in most ways than one, also they can be very informative whether its about slavery or possibly the holocaust. when people think about affensive books or book tittles they think the most apperent ones wich would be about slavery or the holocaust because thats when their family plays a role and so does their past ancestors. katherine paterson has a very good point in her quote at the top of the article just because somthing is offensive to you does it give you the right to take it off the shelf, because if that freedom is given to every one like katherine said, there wouldn't be any books left after that was done and over with. Next thing that was brought to my attention was the double standard of being able to take and remove a book from the shelf a young kid might be doing a report about slavery and how they politicly fought for freedom and but some one might think of that book as offensive and would want to remove it from the shelt. On the young kid's side he just wants to look at the book because it apart of history and that story made it all the way from its time wen it originally happened. Also the same double standard could happen about the holocaust or the vietnam war all of those books could be removed from the shelf because some one found them offensive most americans that fought in the vietnam war came back to america not as heros or brave soles but as baby killers and they were hated even thought they put their life on the line and they just want everyone to forget about if so remove all of those books and the same for the holocaust the jewish people that had family that they grew up with grandma's and grand pa's or mom's and dad's that were taken and were killed dont want to re-live that pain so they want all of those books taken away. Its not just the history books that can have offensive content in them some books be fictoinal but they cam crack a joke or two about somthing that some one doesnt want their child to read so they go ahead and deside to take it off the shelf, I dont think that the people should be allowed to take books off the shelf. I feel like they have to go through a cout system or somthing or talk to the writer about it to possibly make a revision of the book and i know that some books have dropped the word when talking about slavery and i dont think it would be offensive just for the sole reason that it is talking about the history of slavery. So if we start to let every slightly offensive book that appeal to you in that way we wont have that many books left to read, so then looking into the future we will get dumber and dumber as a nation, so in my opinion we shouldnt let books be removed from the shelf. katherine paterson said that if we start taking every offensive book off the shelf the 'we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.",8346,8347.0,katherine paterson brings good point attention  right remove offensive book shelf really offensive historic  I belive books libraries ar stricly professional ways one  also informative whether slavery possibly holocaust  people think affensive books book tittles think apperent ones wich would slavery holocaust thats family plays role past ancestors  katherine paterson good point quote top article somthing offensive give right take shelf  freedom given every one like katherine said  would nt books left done  Next thing brought attention double standard able take remove book shelf young kid might report slavery politicly fought freedom one might think book offensive would want remove shelt  On young kid s side wants look book apart history story made way time wen originally happened  Also double standard could happen holocaust vietnam war books could removed shelf one found offensive americans fought vietnam war came back america heros brave soles baby killers hated even thought put life line want everyone forget remove books holocaust jewish people family grew grandma s grand pa s mom s dad s taken killed dont want relive pain want books taken away  Its history books offensive content books fictoinal cam crack joke two somthing one doesnt want child read go ahead deside take shelf  I dont think people allowed take books shelf  I feel like go cout system somthing talk writer possibly make revision book know books dropped word talking slavery dont think would offensive sole reason talking history slavery  So start let every slightly offensive book appeal way wont many books left read  looking future get dumber dumber nation  opinion shouldnt let books removed shelf  katherine paterson said start taking every offensive book shelf we books left shelf us 
5663,2,"As a highschool student i think that most highschoolers have saw a lot of the stuff that is present in magazines, music and books. I also think that there is a limit to what should be on the shelf. I dont think anything racist should be allowed in a highschool library. I also dont think nething that is visually disturbing should be allowed in school enviroment. I am going to tell you that i think high school students have heard all the cuss words that go along with mature books. I have learned from personal experience that all kids have heard cuss words due to the school enviroment. I think as a highschool student you should be mature enough to handle those words in an adult like manner. I am apposed to however the magazines in the library that have choice pictures. I think some of the pictures highschool kids cannot handle mature enough. I think some pictures have sexual refrences that include atractive girls posing. This is ok, but not alot of young classman can handle this maturely. I think part of growing up is understanding that life isnt perfect and there are going to be people cussing and doing the wrong thing. The important thing to know is to not get caught up in all of that because it will hurt you. If you are mature enought to handle itt real life then you should be mature enought to handle it in a book. I think books can be good books with little fowl language. Sometimes you gotta let your kids grow up and realize lifes not perfect. In conclusion, I think that books are written with language to convey a point. There not just cussing to cuss. It be used to show emotion defeat or even victory.

5664,2,"No, I do not believe that certain material, such as books, music, movies ,magazines, and etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. Removing these items would cause much confusion and difficulty for a lot people. It wouldn't be fair to the adults, younger children should know which materials are appropriate and inappropriate for them, and a lot of stores would get less or run out of business. A library is open to everybody of all ages, meaning adults, children, and elderly people. Younger children should know right from wrong and is wise enough to know which materials are appropriate for their age and which things are not. Libraries have different sections and usually if a minor is found in a section where he/she does not belong, an employee would tell them they are not suppose to be near that certain section. Adults know before they enter a library that there are items with censorship and they should keep their child by their side and make sure he/she does wander off into those adult sections. Libraries have items that everyone of all ages enjoy and it really benefits everyone. So, it wouldn't be fair at all to adults to get rid of certain items that they enjoy. I know if someone was trying to take away materials that us teens like I would be very upset and libraries are a good hang out spot for young adults now days. Adults would feel very betrayed and hurt that things that that enjoy are being taken away from them and no one wants to feel they are treated unfairly. I think that a library would get less business if these items were removed. Most of the business that a library does get is because of these items. If these items were taken elsewhere than they would have less business and they would be in competition with other stores. Some of these items are only available in book stores, such as magazines and many books.

Understanding that children grow up; they start asking question to better understand things that older children and adult knows. You asked me if I thought if removing offensive books would good. I can tell you what I think about that, but my option and other people options are diffent. My option is no. People be sitting here thinking,'' oh my gosh this women is crazy,'' but thats okay. Heres why I think it would be a bad idea. As children get older they want to know more, and some of them dont like getting out of their comfort zone. That means that they would be uncomfortbale to ask their mom's and dad's. That is when they come the the library and the check out their book to find out the information that they are wanting to know. Not only are the books that they read that are offensive to maybe them and someonelse it teaches them a lesson. For example, say a kid checked out a book about a kid, and they were getting picked on, because he wasn't into girls like all the other boys where. It shows how much teasing somebody really hurts. That is how they get tought a lessson. As I think more about it I keep coming up with reason why having atleast some offensive books would be good for the children in the world today. It makes me wonder how many children are accully wanting to know what is going on, or how to do something and are to uncomfortable to go somewhere to talk to someone about it. Or if they even have anybody to talk to to. I really truly hope you guys understand the the thoughts that I have coming out of my head. I truly do.

5666,2,"The debate on wheather or not to include reading material that seem offensive to some people is a good debate. I believe that libraries should keep books, movies and music available to the public; however, the libraries could do more about letting their costumers know what type of material they are looking at. This would be safe for everyone involved because this action would show the public that the library is respectful of everyone. A few suggestions I have would be to separate the materials from all other materials in the library so that children, whose parents don't want them reading or listening to these resources, can know exactly where to go and stay out of. A suggestion for the parents is to suprivise your children for their well being. Also keep the offensive material in its own separate area where there is an appropriate sign labeling this section. I have seen this first-hand. A few months ago I went to the library to collect a few books about a famous poet for an paper that was due soon. I used the library's database to find the right section that I needed and as I was walking back to where the books were, I stopped and looked down and saw a revealing magazine that was extremely innapropriate for the section I was in. I knew that the magazine was missplaced so I took it back where it belonged. It amazed me how careless some libraries can be with shelfing books and other types of media. Some of these mistakes were made by the employees who put the materials away. The libraries should be more careful with the content they put out but I believe that everyone has the right to read, look at or listen to whatever they want to and that the libraries should make that available wheather it be through the actual library itself or through their website. Libraries should give every individual person that choice to decide what to expose themselves to. I agree with author Katherine Paterson about the removing books from a self. She says it quite clearly in that if every parent took off one book that they did not want their child to read and kept it off, then there would be no remaining books for the child to pick from. Children especially have a delicate mind and I strongly urge libraries to change how they look at the material they are putting on display and how they are labeling each resource so that mistakes, like finding an unappropriate magazine that didn't belong, will not happen to anyone else. This should not happen to anyone and I will not stand for this to continue. If neccessary, I will take this to court and have that library tried for indecent exposure to minors.

5667,2,"Removal If you had the ability to remove a book, movie, magazine, etc.. from the shelves, what would your choice(s) be? 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--- that work I abhor----then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author) statement made by Katherine Paterson is one that I would have to agree with. I have also wanted to take certain books off the shelf, because of the content and how the story was written. If I had the power to remove certain books. I would remove quite a few. Removing a book though, after it has already been published is very bad for the economy, and for the author. For one it took alot of money to have all of the copies made for the book, then to ship it, and to have the book removed and disposed of properly would cost a lot. For two the author was proud of theirself for writting a book capable of being published and having it removed would most likely hit them pretty hard. The thing is that many people not have the same opinion on a book then what you have. A book is not written just for your taste. A book is written in the interest of the people who find that type of story entertaining or educational. Having the ability to remove a book is not given out, because when a book is published, it is read by quite a few different people to see if more then just one persons opinion is in approval. I've personally wanted to take off 'To a I found the book to be a little bit to judgemental. It is a story about a man that is falsely accused of rape and has to have a white lawyer defend his case.

5668,2,"Censorship In Libraries are numerous books, magazines, movies, and music that seem to be offensive to certain age groups. Today, most teenagers will observe any type of material that contains: profanity, sexual acts, or offensive language. This type of material leads us to the question, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Music, in many ways, can come across as offensive. Popular artists today sing about: drugs, sexual incounters, profanity, and in some ways, racism. When I listen to an artist, I like to listen to the words, and find out what the artist is really singing about. As an average teenager, we sometimes tend to overlook what the artist is singing about. Sometimes teens listen for the profanity, and sometimes they listen for the story behind the artist's words. I believe, in some ways, music can be offensive, but I believe it should be the parents desicion whether or not the child listens too that type of music. Books, magazines, and movies can be offensive for the pictures, vocabulary, and suggested themes that are in the material. I have read many books, and I agree that some books can be a little suggestive for my age. As for magazines, some pictures or gossip in the magazine can be offensive. Some magazine companies allow the use of profanity, and others do not. Movies, on the other hand, include profanity, crude vocabulary, and unsutable suggested themes for minors. Although all of these observations seem offensive, I believe it should be the parents decision what their child is viewing, and in some ways, the child's responsibility to understanding wether or not the book is sutable for their age group. If any person has the right to view a certain type of material, then their should be equality for another person to view that same material. are multiple materials out that are offensive, but as a citizen, the constitution that every citizen has the right to freedom of speech. If a person sees a material that is offensive to them; instead of taking it off the shelf, they ought to avoid it. So I believe books, magazines, music, and movies should not be removed from library shelves for offensive material.

5669,2,"In a culture where knowledge is unlimited and opinions and veiws are broad, there is question of how far that knowledge is allowed to go. In everything article, book, song, or even movie, there is an opinion. Some are simple, such as prefering one resterant to another, but others have more signifigance. In anything that is written, sung, or acted out, the opinion and veiws behind it could be taken as offensive to one or even several people. But is this simple fact any reason to censor what is put on the shelves of libraries? Each individual has their own set of ideas, veiws, and opinions. These ideas and opinions create the knowledge that fill the shelves of every library. This knowledge is what creates a culture and inspires people to expand their minds to experience new ideas to better form their own. If books currently being read in a high school english class were taken off the shelves of libraries because they could be considered offensive, then knowledge would be lost in the class room. Knowledge comes from each book that is written, each poem that is layed out, and each lyric that is sung. Each one has a new idea at its core, ready to embrace an open mind. The world as a whole learns from these ideas and veiws, wether it's a recipe from a cook book or how to experience the hours in a day with a novel such as '@PERSON1'. There will always be those who find the lyrics of a song to be offensive, but without those lyrics, someone seeking knowledge would not be able to gain it. For every book that is written, song that is played, or article that is published, there will be one person who finds it offensive. But this is a simple fact of life; not everyone agrees with one author's opinion. When one picks a book off of a shelf in a library, there is a choice that is made to open it and read. For those who find a particular song or book offensive, they do not have to choose to read or listen to it. A library does not force anyone to read or listen to something, it is the conscience dession of the reader to do so. With the vast number of opinions, each writter should respect their own views, but also the views of those who will be exposed to their work. There should be respect and open mindness in books, articles, and music, not censorship.

5671,2,"What do you do when you see something offensive? Some people choose to boycott the subject as much as possible; whereas, some people have matured enough that they don't really care. Personally, I'm the type that is mature enough to flip the channel, skip a page, and skip a song on a setlist. It doesn't bother me, but to a lot of people, it's offensive. I do agree, though, that somethings are taken a bit, too, far and should recieve some concern. Yes, my topic is going to be focused on wheather or not offensive subjects or objects should be taken off of shelves. I'll begin this topic on the matter of rights. Let's say a man and women are watching a cartoon on A character on the show expresses a joke that is consider vulgar, and the man starts to laugh hysterically while his wife shows no trace of humor on her face. This example shows that the women had found this joke offensive and doesn't think it's funny, while the husband found nothing wrong with it and is perfectly fine. This is to show that even if something is offensive to someone, it's not offensive to somebody else. Each person is entitled to their own rights and opinions, and I say if it's fine with someone else, then it's fine with me. If a certain person doesn't like it, don't watch, read, or listen to it. It's that easy and can be easily dealt with. My second point is how offensive something is. If it's a little joke that isn't really offensive but to a minority of selected people, then I think it's fine and shouldn't raise any concern. I do think if something is bad enough, like a scene showing a vulgar action, then it should raise concern, especially if it's open to the general public. It be nothing to an older adult, but it can have a massive affect on children. If a young child sees something as offensive as that, it could cause mental and social problems, and no child should be exposed to that type of offensiveness. Subjects like these should be taken off of the and shelves. Last, but not least, is the matter of if offensive objects should be taken off shelves. No single person has the authority to take everything that is offensive to them and get rid of it from society. This would anger people who don't agree with that person, and that person would be furious that those people don't think the same way that they do. The whole topic itself is a circle; there is no one way to fix everything. Nobody wins the matter and nobody loses. It's just better to leave things as it is, and if something is bad enough, then it should raise some concern, but people need to look at it from both sides. Like I stated earlier, what be offensive to someone not be offensive to somebody else. All in all, the matter of wheather or not a piece of material is offensive and should be taken off shelves is a hetic debate. There is always two sides to the story. People either don't care if something is offensive or there's people who do care. Yes, I believe that children shouldn't be exposed to material like that, but I also believe that everybody has their own right. There is never going to be a perfect solution to the matter, but that's fine with me.

5672,2,"Off the Shelves? I Think A piece of information, no matter what it contains, as long as it is appropriate for its audience, should be removed from the eyes of the public. It is discriminization to do such an action. The people have a right to state what they believe is true. If it were your book, song, etc, you'd want the public to have a view on it. The purpose of these products is for the entertainment, persuasion, or the information, and what meaning does it hold if it is taken away from what makes it viewable? It wouldn't make sense to 'point fingers' at certain pieces of information that were meant to be. If others are allowed to have a part to take in the library then shouldn't it as well? An example could be a book such as '@CAPS2 We by Yes it offend some people that read the book, but is simply a man that has the right to say what he feels; he never forced a person to make a choice they didn't want to. Would you be able to give a logical reason for allowing freedom of speech? I'm pretty sure I wouldn't. If you didn't have the ability to share what you believed in with others, how would you feel? It is even said in the that we, as citizens, have that right. If we lived in a world without the knowledge of other people's beliefs or opinions, in my eyes, I don't think we would be very far on this planet. Think about this situation personally; if a piece of information was produced by you and had held great meaning in your eyes, wouldn't you feel that you deserve to have your information viewed in the public eye? Think of a novel that is very popular now in time, 'The of A man had kept his life due to her writings, who was her father. We all learned more and more about the tragedies that and her family faced during and to this day, her novel becomes an inspiration to many others, more and more as we speak, being the top copied and translated book in the world excluding the If you were you'd be proud that the people laid eyes on what you've produced. Now in days, books, movies, magazines, and many other products are shown and they all have a reason to them, an important meaning for they exist. If they can't be seen in the libraries, should they exist at all if they have their meaning for being here taken away? They are meant to be seen and heard of, which is they should remain in the libraries. The producers do say that we must take in their beliefs; they state their purpose for creating their products and nothing more, just as I have done here. The people have their opinions on the productions made, but the creators of them have just as much rights to make that information as the public does to criticize about it.",8366,8367.0,Off Shelves  I Think A piece information  matter contains  long appropriate audience  removed eyes public  It discriminization action  The people right state believe true  If book  song  etc  d want public view  The purpose products entertainment  persuasion  information  meaning hold taken away makes viewable  It would nt make sense point fingers  certain pieces information meant  If others allowed part take library nt well  An example could book   CAPS We Yes offend people read book  simply man right say feels  never forced person make choice nt want  Would able give logical reason allowing freedom speech  I m pretty sure I would nt  If nt ability share believed others  would feel  It even said  citizens  right  If lived world without knowledge people s beliefs opinions  eyes  I nt think would far planet  Think situation personally  piece information produced held great meaning eyes  would nt feel deserve information viewed public eye  Think novel popular time  The A man kept life due writings  father  We learned tragedies family faced day  novel becomes inspiration many others  speak  top copied translated book world excluding If d proud people laid eyes ve produced  Now days  books  movies  magazines  many products shown reason  important meaning exist  If ca nt seen libraries  exist meaning taken away  They meant seen heard  remain libraries  The producers say must take beliefs  state purpose creating products nothing  I done  The people opinions productions made  creators much rights make information public criticize

5674,2,"Offensive Materials Libraries have many books for children of all ages and adults as well. But are they all to the human eye? Just walking into a library full of books and adventures can change your mind about that. Most people say books are offensive because of the language some books or novels have in their texture. Some magazines have nudity in them which are at easy access for children and teens. This is not what parents want their children to see when they go to a neighborhood public library. Parents want their children to be able to go to a library without having to worry about what they could end up seeing. I say that all libraries should take the Magazines of the shelfs because of what they children are seeing, women in bikinis showing of most of their bodies which children shouldnt be seeing at a young age. This is what parents don't want their six or seven year olds looking at these types of magazines. I have gone to many libraries and i have seen children that are only about ten years old taking a peek at these magazines behind a shelf hiding. How would that look in a public library where there is suppose to be supervision for the minors. where the librarians should be carefull on what they are putting on te shelfs. This tells that childrern have easy access to these types of magazines or books, if its not either at home its at a public library. Now I want the parents to come in and vote on this as a community at a public library. So the parents as well could take a look around the library to take a peek on what their children are capable of seeing on a daily baises when their parents are not around.

Taking away books or music is like taking away part of a persons personality. The first reason I believe that there is no book or music that should be taken off the shelves is because the people who make them spend hours, days, weeks, and probably even months on them so their supporters could like it. I know I have never written a book or made a track in the recording studio but I know the people who do waste a lot of money tryin to make it the best they can. Artist and authors want their supporters to be excited when they hear about the next album or book but that wouldnt be possible if they start removing books and albums. Me personally; I like both music and stories about violence and people who grew up with a very difficult life and made it because I like the story in them it isn't anything other than that it just interest me. For example if I were to go to the store one day to get the newest cd that I have been waiting for its arrival for several months and they took it off the shelf I know for a fact that I will be both confused and disappointed. The second reason I believe that there is no book or album that should be taken off the shelves is because they are what relaxes and sooths people. When people are hard at work or studying at school they want to go home so they could have some time to relax and they turn on their music or sit down and read a book. I know some people dont really believe that music about violence or life stories could be relaxing but people who could relate to it find it entertaining. When people read books they usually do it to either learn something or to just entertain themselves but why would you try preventing from learning something? One quote that several of my teachers have told me was '@CAPS3 could take things from you but the thing they could never take from you is your knowledge.' The brain is the most important thing in your body and once you learn something new it goes straight into your memory. The third reason that I believe that there is no book that should be taken off the shelves is because you will displease hundreds and thousands of people. Those whom believe that certain books or music should be taken off the shelves should just avoid that isle or just not worry about them. Telling somebody what they can or can't read or liaten to is like telling what they can or can't wear, can or can't eat and even where they can or can't live. It really doesnt make sense that people would care what others think about authors and artist books and music since we have the right to listen to and read anything that catches our attention. Authors and artist have freedom of just like anyone else so why cant they write and sing what they feel like writing or singing? In conclusion I think everyone has the right to listen to or read whatever they want. People being themselves is what makes this country and if people weren't able to access the things that sooth and relax them from a hard day of work they just wouldn't be themselves. People come here for the '@CAPS4 and they should be able to listen to any genre of music and read any genre of books. That is the last and most important reason that i believe no book or album should be taken off the shelves.",8372,8373.0,Freedom reads books  magazines  articles much tell exact thing people listen music watch movies  tell dont like one genre books music  They tell like variety books music end liking things others dont  If people want read specific genre book listen certain type music let  Taking books music shelves satisfy people gaurantee also make lot people enraged  Taking away books music like taking away part persons personality  The first reason I believe book music taken shelves people make spend hours  days  weeks  probably even months supporters could like  I know I never written book made track recording studio I know people waste lot money tryin make best  Artist authors want supporters excited hear next album book wouldnt possible start removing books albums  Me personally  I like music stories violence people grew difficult life made I like story nt anything interest  For example I go store one day get newest cd I waiting arrival several months took shelf I know fact I confused disappointed  The second reason I believe book album taken shelves relaxes sooths people  When people hard work studying school want go home could time relax turn music sit read book  I know people dont really believe music violence life stories could relaxing people could relate find entertaining  When people read books usually either learn something entertain would try preventing learning something  One quote several teachers told   CAPS could take things thing could never take knowledge   The brain important thing body learn something new goes straight memory  The third reason I believe book taken shelves displease hundreds thousands people  Those believe certain books music taken shelves avoid isle worry  Telling somebody ca nt read liaten like telling ca nt wear  ca nt eat even ca nt live  It really doesnt make sense people would care others think authors artist books music since right listen read anything catches attention  Authors artist freedom like anyone else cant write sing feel like writing singing  In conclusion I think everyone right listen read whatever want  People makes country people nt able access things sooth relax hard day work would nt  People come   CAPS able listen genre music read genre books  That last important reason believe book album taken shelves 
5676,2,"Why would libraries be forced to clean out all of their materials that are considered 'offensive'? The library shouldn't have to throw out any offensive music, books, movies, or magizines just because they are found not suitible for kids. Libraries should find ways to keep the offensive materials away from kids, without throwing them away. Every book in a way have some kind of need for censorship. I have noticed a very easy and productive way of doing this, by creating a room which contains all of the inapropriate materials. Offensive materials would be censored into a confined room. The room would take away all of your worry from kids getting into offensive materials. The kids for one, could not enter, but have to have an adult of over years of age to access. There would be a guard or person protecting the room, so nobody would enter without being Parents would have a worry free mind when going into a library with their kids knowing that they won't get into any inapropriate materials.

5677,2,"A library is a place for those of all ages to sink to a book to learn, to use their imagination, to go to a mysteist far off place. Libraries have always been for children, teens, adults, and everyone inbetween. Taking away some of the reading options for these library go-ers would be a horrible thing. Taking away a series of books because one religion finds it unjust, or emilinating books by a certain author just because some find the author's style or tone wrong for children to read. This is just plain wrong. For many the library is a place to be yourself, to pick out a book or magazine that is about something you really enjoy and curl up into a big comfy chair and lose yourself in a great book or magazine. Removing items from the library could change this of some people, these people many not be allowed to read their most beloved book at he library because some think that it is 'too offensive'. The library shelves should always contain books, movies, music, and magazines for everyone to enjoy, the young, the old, and the young at heart. A library should contain every type of book or magazines from picture to complex stories, from love stories to thrilling murder novels, and every author from A to A library should be allowed to contain music from screamo to classical. The shelves should be able to have movies from romantic comedy to documentaries. To remove certain books, movies, music or magazines from the shelves because of the content, the author, the language, or the pictures are 'too offensive' is wrong to do. It is unfair for one group of people to declair that a book is too volguer to have in libraries, because everyone has a different opinion of what offensive. For example it would be unjust to remove items from the library because a group of moms think that their children shouldn't be able to read romatic books, or because a religious group think that it is wrong that the library has too much information about and not enough about their religion. If parents don't like that books, movies, music, or magazines that their child is picking from a library then that parent should watch what their kid is pick out and not allow them that certain book or movie. Those parents should not rush to the front desk in a panic and demand that the library remove that content at once, because many people have different definitions of offensive. Offensive in one persons mind might be that a 'bad word' is used, another think that is perfectly fine. Some think that wizards and witches are offensive, while others might particularly enjoy those types of books. Some believe that their religious book is the only one that should be used in the library, while others think their holy books is better suited for that type of library or community. Basically what I am saying is that offensive means a wide varitiy to different people, so there is no way that a few people should be allowed to determain what books, movies, magazines, or music are too 'offensive' to be on the shelves of libraries everywhere.",8376,8377.0,A library place ages sink book learn  use imagination  go mysteist far place  Libraries always children  teens  adults  everyone inbetween  Taking away reading options library goers would horrible thing  Taking away series books one religion finds unjust  emilinating books certain author find author s style tone wrong children read  This plain wrong  For many library place  pick book magazine something really enjoy curl big comfy chair lose great book magazine  Removing items library could change people  people many allowed read beloved book library think too offensive   The library shelves always contain books  movies  music  magazines everyone enjoy  young  old  young heart  A library contain every type book magazines picture complex stories  love stories thrilling murder novels  every author A A library allowed contain music screamo classical  The shelves able movies romantic comedy documentaries  To remove certain books  movies  music magazines shelves content  author  language  pictures too offensive  wrong  It unfair one group people declair book volguer libraries  everyone different opinion offensive  For example would unjust remove items library group moms think children nt able read romatic books  religious group think wrong library much information enough religion  If parents nt like books  movies  music  magazines child picking library parent watch kid pick allow certain book movie  Those parents rush front desk panic demand library remove content  many people different definitions offensive  Offensive one persons mind might bad word  used  another think perfectly fine  Some think wizards witches offensive  others might particularly enjoy types books  Some believe religious book one used library  others think holy books better suited type library community  Basically I saying offensive means wide varitiy different people  way people allowed determain books  movies  magazines  music offensive  shelves libraries everywhere

5680,2,"Should certain books or material be taken off the shelf because someone finds it offensive? My opinion is no, because other people might like the book, cd, and etc. If someone thought your favorite book was offensive and got it taken off the shelves you couldn't tell a person to get this book at the library and read it. You would either give yours to them or they would have to buy it. Nowadays, everything is offensive, so if we took all the books down that people thought were offensive, then there would not be that many books left. If you think a book is offensive then don't read it or go to the library were it is at. Some books not be appropriate for your child, but that means don't let them read it until you think they are ready to read it.What we don't need to do is take books and other materials off the shelves because people think they are offensive. We need to leave them there, because although it offend some people, it inspire others. Music and movies are the same way. If you think a movie or song is offensive don't watch or listen to it. For example my mom, when I was little, thought a song was offensive, so she didn't complain and try to get it taken off the radio or shelves in the library, she just changed the station and we kept going. It is ok to think something is offensive , but don't ruin for someone else if you think it is offensive and they don't. We all have our own likes and dislikes, and sometimes we don't agree, but maybe on this one thing people will agree and move on.

What do you think; I hope that after reading this you come to the same conclusion as me. I think that you should be able to get whatever you want at a library. If something in a library offends someone, no one is forcing them to read it: they have the choice. This is the same way with television just because somebody finds that offencive does not mean that they will take the show off air. The television networks have that right, to show whatever they want to. Afterall, they could change the channel, just like libraries all they would have to do is go get another book. If they did censor movies, books, magazines, music and anything of that nature there would not be nearly the selection that their is today. There is something that people could misunderstand and take offence to in almost everything. Where would that leave us? With nothing to read, watch, or listen to, thats where it would leave us. In my personal experience I have observed that when it comes to censoring it just leaves you with arguement. So why would we want to take out anything that could offend someone when all they have to do is simply not read it, or watch it, or listen to it.

5682,2,"Should material be removed from library shelves because might be offensive? I don't think so. People should have the right to read and watch what ever they want. And, the people who find offensive have the right to ignore and not pick up the materials they dislike. I don't think certain materials should be taken off of library shelves because some things not be as offensive to others, just depends on the perspective. If you are religious and you find that a book is disrespectful to your religion, then you have a choice not to get that book and to read a different one. Same thing if you are not religious and you find a bible or a religious movie, you don't have to read or watch Some people believe music with curse words in is automatically bad; or if you can't understand what the band is singing about because they are screaming, just awful music. I believe freedom of expression and opinion. Anyone can have an opinion on something, but won't be the same as another's. I love heavy music, but my grandparents aren't forced to listen to Times have changed with music, movies, books, and much more. really all depends on how you look at everything. Such as nudity. Is disgusting or is the human body a beautiful thing? I had an experience like that once, at a library. There was a woman there with her son. Her little boy was looking at some art books, he just wanted to see the pretty pictures. The little boy came across a book that had something to do with drawing the human body. The book did have nudity, but the child was too young to understand anything about in a sexual way. The mother got very upset at the librarian because her little boy was looking at 'pornographic images.' was a drawing book, not anything pornographic. The mother of the little boy found the book to be offensive, but wouldn't be to any artist.

I agree that many things in libraries, such as those conviniently stupid vampire books, but thats my opinion, should not be open to the public for indecency reasons, and that censorship is a good thing. Its wrong to censor everything, and even more wrong to censor nothing.

Now yes, I do get mad when I cant watch that movie on because its rated but is it really worth listening and learning how to use all those cuss words? Society is just a better place when everyone minds there manners, and libraries are a place where good things and manners should be taught. Just because a kid wants to look for an adventure, doesnt mean he or she needs to read, watch, or hear about killing or sex. Plus, age should be a huge considering factor when deciding what should be censored. Adults can handle more mature things, or hopefully thats the case. School libraries have every right to censor books that have even a little bit of gore in them, and they should.

If it is a public library then they might want to look into censorship so that when a kid under tries to look at or watch something that has adult content in it then there should be censorship. I dont feel that this topic is offensive in any way. Censorship is actually a safeguard for children. But any human being has the right to follow up on their choosen topic such as political veiws, astronomy, music, etc. If censorship were happening in ancient times how would we know history for example how would we know how the egyptians built the pyramids. I think the people who created this thing called censorship, should look at what their trying to do and how it would affect the people of the world. I like being able to go to the library and look at read or watch anything i please to. If people weren't aloud to do this we wouldnt know what is going on in this world filled with things to hear about.

5685,2,"Today there are many things in libraries that do not want their kids to view or listen to. It is a big question if libraries should remove such offensive items from the shelf, but in my opinion certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are many reasons why I feel this way and the reasons are: should have enough control over their children to tell them what they can and cannot have and the children should accept it, other people look and listen to these items, and librarians should put age limits on these items.@CAPS1 should be able to tell their child that they can or cannot have or do something without the child throwing a tantrum. One of the problems I see with removing these items from the shelf is because if the children are not allowed viewing or listening to offensive content then there should be an age limit on them. Many things in the library are marked with ratings and if they are not they should be. That would be a vital solution to the problem. By doing so the librarian will have complete control to be able to say that the rating is rated too graphic for kids if it is and they would not be able to purchase it without their approval. Then there would be no complaint.Another reason libraries should not remove certain books that offend some people, is because grown adults might be interested in some of the items people take to offense. If other people want to use books, music, movies, etc. that can be offensive they should be able to if they see nothing wrong with it. Adults have the right to do basically between fine lines what ever they want because they are adults. By removing things that some adults like it would make the library lose customers and maybe even put them out of business.I honestly think these ways would be better solutions than just removing things that offend some people. Some adults get offended by a lot of things easily and just like in the quote Katherine Paterson made, that if we take the books off the shelf because a few of the population are offended by them, there would be no books left on the shelves for anyone",8392,8393.0,Today many things libraries want kids view listen  It big question libraries remove offensive items shelf  opinion certain materials  books  music  movies  magazines  etc  removed shelves found offensive  There many reasons I feel way reasons  enough control children tell children accept  people look listen items  librarians put age limits items   CAPS able tell child something without child throwing tantrum  One problems I see removing items shelf children allowed viewing listening offensive content age limit  Many things library marked ratings  That would vital solution problem  By librarian complete control able say rating rated graphic kids would able purchase without approval  Then would complaintAnother reason libraries remove certain books offend people  grown adults might interested items people take offense  If people want use books  music  movies  etc  offensive able see nothing wrong  Adults right basically fine lines ever want adults  By removing things adults like would make library lose customers maybe even put businessI honestly think ways would better solutions removing things offend people  Some adults get offended lot things easily like quote Katherine Paterson made  take books shelf population offended  would books left shelves anyone
5686,2,"When walking into a movie store, people do not walk to the children's and expect to find movies with adult content. The same concept applies for the situation in libraries. Some people push with all the facts they have to remove certain books from the library. However, these books should be left on the shelf. The libraries in a city are not in charge of what children are exposed to. The parents are to blame if the child reads a book that is not acceptable for his or her age group. When a parent walks his or her young student into the library, it is the parent's responsibility to direct the child to the room labeled 'Children's are innapropriot materials everywhere you go; this includes simple places like and even the library. An adult's job is to guide and distract the children away from being exposed to adult level materials. Looking back, I can remember reading the controversial 'To a in school at the eighth grade level. In some schools, this book was taken off the shelf in its library. At my school, a note was sent home to be signed by the parents to have permission to read the book. This concept is simple, but it was an appropriot step to having the content checked. Once again, this whole argument ties back to the parental censorship and not the library's. A parent has most of the control over what their son or daughter is reading. To go along with 'To a this book is an classic. I remember every kid in my class enjoyed this book. Kids were reading ahead and finishing the book before the assigned chapters were due. Books like this one keep kids excited about reading and off their beloved If classic books with a hint of adult material are taken away, kids will not care to read as much. Parents allow their children to watch movies with smoking and sexual humor for the adults. What is the difference if it is decribed in a book or seen on Classic movies are seen by millions of people, and classic books should be kept on the shelf at libraries. Libraries get frowned upon for leaving certain books on the shelf.

5687,2,"The whole idea of it being offensive, to me that is an oppion statment that can be viewed in vary many different ways. The library should be aloud to do what it wants with its books, magazines, movies, etc. For one thing to be offensive to one person and not another, is an opinion. There are many types of religions, races, sports, types of muisc, movies. They all have different views on things that can be offensive and non offensive. There are books in your home town library that can be offensive to a younger child, that arent offensive to a teenage boy. There is a book in my high school library, and many other libraries that i have been in, called it is a baseball book, about how a boy lives on a farm and is starting his own tteam and gets some of his friends together and plays. But there are some graphical details in this tory, some parts talk about sexual content with teenages and they take about stuff like that going on and they describe it in details. To me that would be fine for a highschool and middle school aged kid to read, because they should have been taught about this stuff recently in there schools. But for this book to be in a public library and for little children to be able to read and hear about this suff, to me is not right and there should be limitations on the way things happen. But there are ways for people abnd libaries too see that there are different views and that some people see things more offensive then other.

5688,2,"Alot of people believe that some material in libraries today are offensive to others. The local library carries more than just books. If u go into a library you will see music cd's, movies, magazines and computers. The evolution of the library has changed over time. Now people are starting to come up with the conclusion that libraries carry offenisve and adult friendly books and those books should be removed from the shelves. I believe that those books are intended for the readers who want to read those type of books. Most people in america go into libraries for research and not for the pure pleasure of reading books. Since technology has grown over the years there really isn't a big use for a library in modern society. There are alot of conservative people in the world that don't like to read books with voulger and graphic images and texts. Those type of books are not intended for people who act in a conservative manor. Children today find themselves asking alot of questions about the world and their parents would rather give them the information themselves than telling them to read a book about it. Libraries carry alot of information than can trace back thousands of years, but they can not give the traditional wisdom that a mother, father, grandfather, or grandmother can give. In libraries today you will barely find a child from the ages of reading a book quietly in a library. Offensive materials are everywere besides library books. You would find children in the library on the computer than in the library reading books. I understand that people believe that some books shouldnt be in libraries but its not fair for a person who is interested in offensive materials to have to go buy a book when they can read it for free at their local library. People believe that children can easily read smut and voulger books in libraries but the truth is that the childrens books are seperated from the adult friendly books. Children can't even pick up or come in contatct with an adult book in a library. Most people who complain about graphic books in the libraries have children or has had a child they have came in contact with who had read a voulger book. If a child reads a voulger book its the parents fault for not establishing that they can't read that type of material and that it is inapropriate for their age. In conclusion you can not take away offensive books off of libraries shelves because it appeal to different people and its not fair that they can't read what they want to read and you can. If a child reads a voulger book or magazine its the parents fault for not setting ground rules. It is impossible for young children to read smut in libraries because they are not aloud to go into the adult book section.

I think that books for middle school should be censored because some of the material that are in books these days are to muture for that age group. Censorship should deffently be put in to action for those of a younger age group. Music today is everywhere and we all hear it all of the time. It has been censored for as long as I can remeber, you can buy it edited or unedited whatever you want to here. The radio stations already have to be censored for everyones ears, no matter if you like it or not it's just the way it is. Personally I cant go one single day without listening to music. When I was little my parents made sure that everything I used, listed to,watched, or did was censored so that I was not exposed to inapproate things. Of course you cant stop everything from getting to your ears or eyes all of the time. The things kids are exposed to today might or will effect what the do or the way they go about doing things. Of course the things that we are taught will shape how our future will turn out. Uncensored books sometimes helps us learn how things were or how things were said back a long time ago. Its kind of like history wraped up in a story sometimes. History is a very important thing to learn as you are growing up. If we censored history kids would grow up being a little mislead about things that have happend in the past. All in all if we censored everything then most people would be deprived of education and some history. Also parts of history would be erased and maybe even lost.

5692,2,"Why remove books from librabries when they share the information from all different times of periods to help the world understand what actually went on? Is it right to hide the facts from the world? Some people think it is completely wrong for books that are offensive to them to be on the shelf, but it is reality. They must understand what they are living in and when they look around, those books that seem offensive, is what is happeneing in the world today. Taking books off of the library shelves that are too offensive to some people will leave our libraries empty. When going into a library, there are hundreds upon hundreds of books on shelves. They range from autobiographies to nonfictions to children's books and even to fiction books. Almost every book in the library is going to be a little offensive to atleast one person in the world. If libraries were to remove every book that did not show censorship to one person, our libraries would be empty. Looking at everyone's perspective of censorship, it is understandable why they feel the way they do sometimes, but they have to realize it is reality. There are books on war, killings, books with bad language, raising a child, and the list goes on and on. Taking books away on wars will leave our world with multiple unanswered questions. People not like how everything went down in the war, but if it was not for the war, they would not be where they are today in society. Books with bad language sometimes do go too far, but they want to get their point across. There are books on how to raise your children and not every one is going to have the same standards and perspectives on raising children and that is why every person in the world is different. There is a point where people have to open their eyes up and realize this world we are all living in, is not a perfect world like every one wants it to be. People make mistakes. Some people even say things that are offensive to someone else. Authors of books are going to keep writing books and they are not going to be everyone's first option. They are going to come off a little offensive to some, but removing them from shelves just because they seem offensive, is not right. Books are written for people to understand the world, to understand people that got the world to where it is today, to go over and beyond with your imagination, and to basically just understand the way of life. How can we take that away from the world? From the children? The world needs to be told things and it be going through books, magazines, movies, or even music, but it is all not going to be bright and beautiful. There are going to be clowdy days. People need to understand the way of life and to understand this world we are all living in, is by no means perfect. Books are going to come off offensive.

5695,2,"Many kids in the world like to read books. Some like to read adventurous, thrillers, comedies, and even romance. Unfortunately, some people like to read, listen to, or watch certain materials that are offensive to religions, countries, and a wide variety of cultures. I personally think that cencorship in libraries should be strict. People that read these types of books, watch movies, or even listen to explicit music would be misguiding to the minds of people of all ages. Movies can show false information about different religions and cultures and, eventually, leading a certain individual's mind to an idea that is not even true; books and music can also do the exact same thing. The different cultures and religions of a country are not the only things that people can find offensive. Gender inequalities also offend others. Guys can listen to music that only have a negative thought towards girls, or vice versa. These types of music lead males and females to have both groups turn against each other. Books and movies have the same affect as well. Books and movies can have specific roles or important characters that would be a male or a female when others think it should be this or that; this is why people are effected by this. Along with many people, misleading infromation, that comes from music, books, magazines, and movies, has had an affect on me. I find this material extremely offensive, coming from my point of view; i am, specifically, I have saw articles from magazines that are very misleading to the public about and their cultures. They make remarks about the culture and translate it into a negative way. Most people would not research if it were to be true, or not. They would most likely believe it. It's exactly the same with music, books, and movies. The words and information are basically fed to the public and they would just eat it right up; this would cause tensions between different ethnic groups. So the question is, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removes from the shelves if they are found offensive? I most certainly do believe it should happen. I don't see why people would go through the effort and write down false information. When writing about a story that includes some kind of culture, they should research the topic.

5698,2,"The whole idea of censorship is meant to pose limitations. It puts limitations on what books, movies, magazines, and music are publically available in our society. However, censorship harbors a fine line between limitations and outright restrictions. If you limit the book options in a library just because the opitions some books do not match the popular viewpoint of society, are you restricting the rights for someone else? The answer is yes. Freedom of speech is a vital component of the constitution, and in order to uphold this value and idea, written, published, and other forms of media cannot be restricted. The original goal of censorship was to maintain age restrictions on certain materials. This was and still is a very important restriction, because it is not an infringment of rights. It is merley sheilding concepts from the younger generations that will still be available to them in a few years when they get older. The library should not put graphic novels in the children's section; reading material like that at such a young age could potentially pose pscycological problems later on. Music with explatives describing innappropriate scenerios should be kept far away from the children's in the library. Restrictions on age are neccessariy in society to keep the kids acting and thinking on kids. This type of restriction does not last forever; as the children grow into teenagers and then adults they too will have access to the material. But until then, they need to be shielded from certain topics. The problem with censorship is when it moves from shielding little kids from inappropriate topics, from removing reading or digital material because others believe that they are 'offensive', or basically do not agree with the contents. In my perspective, this is as bad as book burning. During the threw an uncountable number of books in the flames, just because the content of the books was contreversial. Taking book off the shelves because one does not agree with the content imposes on the rights of another individual. In today's democratic society, or in any modern if someone speaks their mind they are not tossed into jail. Someone who might not agree with them can refute their points and the whole scenerio can turn into an argument, but at the end of the day the thoughts of both people are expressed. In every library I have been to, and almost all libraries in the books are categorized by sections. Just as children's books stay in the children's section, books are usually found in sections. If one does not agree with a fundamental idea, he/she can just leave the section and go to a different one. There is a countless number of books in the library, it is not difficult to find a book you actually agree with. Just because one person or even a group of people do not agree with a certain idea, they do not have the right to remove it from the library shelf. Freedom of speech is a fundamental block of democratic identity. No one has the right to infringe upon the rights of the individual who actually wants to read the contreversial book.

5699,2,"There are certain types of material that should not be allowed in public libraries, and people should have the right to ask the library to remove that material from the library. I know that if I were a parent with younger children I would not want them going into the library and picking out a pornographic magazine or book. Certain types of music should also be kept out of libraries such as explicit rap music. When it comes to removing certain types of literature from the shelves of a library I see no productive reason to have inapropriate magazines or music in a public library. The public library should be a place where children and adults can come to relax and read a good book. Parents should not have to worry about what kinds of books or magazines their children will be reading. Explicit music also has no place in a library. There is already enough influence on the younger generations from this kind of music and putting it in a library would only encourage more children and young adults to look up to those so called rap 'stars'. In my own life I have dealt with these types of influences and inapropriate material enough to know that there is nothing good that can come out of putting it in a public library. My parents have raised me in such a way that I know that these materials are bad and when I have children of my own I do not want them to go through the same struggles I have gone through. I am very glad that my public library keeps inapropriate material off their shelves, and I believe that all libraries should do the same. Libraries should be very careful with what they allow on their shelves. No library should allow inapropriate magazines, movies, or music because of the bad message that they send.

I think censorship should be used to create some boundaries as to what younger childen are reading, watching, and listening to.Although, I believe in censorship in libraries and other public places I do not think that books, magazines,or music that are found offensive should be taken off the shelves as a whole.Instead I think they should all be kept in a solitary place that only allows a certain age group.I think by doing this libraries would have created boundaries for younger children while still meeting everyone else's needs. Also I think the use of censorship instead of complete removal of offensive material from the shelves would be more beneficial to everyone because everyone has different opinions and what be offensive to one not be offensive to others.

I believe that all books should stay in libraries, regardless if they are offensive or not. For arguements sake, let's say that books will be removed from libraries if a single complaint is filed. People would come up with multiple reasons to complain. They could say that there is a curse word, a racial slur, a foreign race mentioned, sexual content, anger suggestions, bad influences, laws being broken, incorrect information, and even religious controversy. Different people find different things offensive. Complaints like these would leave libraries emtpy. This would be horrible. People would not be able to check books out for free anymore. There would be nothing left to read. Libraries purposely put books into diffenent sections. There are children, adult, teen, history, science, music, movie, culture, and even cooking sections in the library. The age sections are made to let us know that what is appropriate for our own age groups. A child should not check out an adult book. Sometimes if the rating is too high, they aren't even allowed to check that book out. This should alone solve people's complaints on offensiveness. People need to be more open minded.

5703,2,"When it comes to censorship, I do not think that libraries should be affected. A library is a place to go when you need a certain book, movie, magazine, etc. If these materials were removed from the library, where will the reader go to find his or her desired book? I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from the shelves of a library. Your public library should be a place that you can depend on to have the book or material that interests you. If someone were to find a certain material offensive, then they should alert the librarian and maybe the librarian can put it aside or atleast in a different location. Everyone has something that they are offended by, but removing a material that be helpful to somebody, is not the answer. So as you can tell, a library is not a place to contain censored materials. It is a place that you can go to for whatever material you need, whether it be offensive to some, or not.

5704,2,"Dear Newspaper We need to not censor books because in the end we will end up having no books for us to read. If we have no books to read then how will we gain knowledge about what has happened in the past? Also if we do not have books then we would not be able to read because there would be no need to. With my experiance reading the book in this book nobody was allowed to have books. If they were caught with books then all the books were burned and many times the people that had the books were burned also because they didnt want to lose their whole collection or they were burned to death not knowing what was happening. So if we arent allowed to have books then our lives could possibly be at stake. Also the people didn't have a clue about anything that was going on in the world, they voted on a president because of his looks not his agenda. Do we want our world to beccome like this? If we ban books becuase they are offensive to one group of people or one person, then every group or every person that reads a book that they don't like or the don't like the author will ask for the book to be banned. If everyone in the world doesn't like one book then all the books in the world would be banned and we wouldn't ahve anything to read and we wouldn't be able to educated ourselves. If we can't educate ourselves then it would be the end of our world because without education or knowledge then we wouldn't know anything about our history so we would not have any idea about how to run a country do we would be wiped of the globe by the countries that know how to read because then they would know what to do to run a country succesfully.

5705,2,"Imagine going to the library in search for a book on slavery in or concentration camps from time and not being able to retrieve that book because its contents were said to be offensive. Every person has their own opinion and the definition of what is offensive is different among everyone. If a piece of literature is said to be offensive I do not believe anyone has the right to remove that work from a library. Each individual's opinion differs from the next. We are given the right of freedom of expression but when a person feels that a book should be removed due to content, a line is crossed. The author of the article or novel has the right to express themselves, even if that be in a vulgar or disrespectful way. It is your choice whether or not you read that book, but not your decision to remove it from access of others. Due to freedom of expression, no one can remove an author's work because of its said to be offensive content. While we as have the right to express ourselves, we do not have authority over our fellow citizens. I cannot say to my neighbor that his opinions are invalid and entirely wrong because I have no power to do so. At the end of the quote by Katherine Paterson she says, '...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' I think she offers a valild point. No one has the authority to intentionally extract a book from a library because they assume the author is unintelligent or degrading due to the content of their book. If they were to do so the library would be bare due to differing views on what is offensive. Everyone has access to libraries, which is why they can be called public libraries. When something is public it means that all citizens are allowed to use the facilities, businesses or programs as long as it is in a respectful or nondisruptive way. When a library is public the literature, magazines or other forms of media belong to the public itself, not just a single user of the establishment. I feel that removing a book from a library due to content is wrong because it does not belong specifically to you, the book belongs to the public. Opinions can be found everywhere and many of them are differing. The media, books, or magazines in a library are not any one person's property therefore no one is allowed to remove them from the rest of the public's access. We all have the freedom of expression and can publish what ever we feel neccessary. No one person has the authority to remove another person's words because they feel it is vulgar or rude.

5706,2,"Libraries are all over the world. Each one has over a thousand unique books. These books range from fiction to religion, even to laughter. All of these books found throughout are for educational purposes. Libraries are expected to have books about everything. People go to libraries to look up information, for the enjoyment of reading, and the luxery of peace and quite. If libraries didn't have books for history, how would people understand what went on. If there weren't children books, how would children learn to talk and read. Different people all over the world take different things offensively. If one person found a book offensive and the libraries took it off the shelf, what about the next person. That person might enjoy learning about that specific topic. After a while, there wouldn't be anything left to read. People take offense to different things, but that doesn't mean remove it for just that person. If it is offensive to them they'll go find another book. There are so many choices to pick from. Magazines and movies also have the same effect. Some people watch movies in disgust. To others it might be their favorite movie. Moive are only made for entertainment. Moivemakers make billions on any type of movie, from scary to sad. Magazines, on the other hand, are full of gossip from the famous life. To us, does that really matter? Its their life being spread out on paper. We read them to get a good laugh. But dont get me wrong some magazines are helpful. There are all kinds. '@CAPS1 and '@CAPS3' are opropriate choices. These type influence people to do things and live lives. If one person found something offensive in that, it wouldn't be there to benefit someone else. In the music world there are also all types. From classical to to hip hop. Everybody listens to music. But everybody has different tastes in the type they enjoy. The older generation enjoys the classical. This generation listens to hip hop and rap. Music is the same as the rest, people have different tastes and if we got ride of a song because one person didn't like it, what about those who do. Libraries serve a very important purpose to the lives of many people across the world. Without them and all the books, full of information and excitement, how would we learn? How would we strive to be Books, magazines, movies, and music are here for the simple pleasure of us human beings. Removing such things from public places of education serves no purpose. It doesn't benefit one person nor does it hurt them. When you go to look for items to read and listen to, find a section of books or stack of songs.

5707,2,"Many books in the world are stored in libraries, but the thing is that many people think that some of them should not be in there. Books that are uncensored some times have foul language, nudity, and or descriptive examples of suicied and killings. Censored books on the other hand have none of that, they are more for children and immature teenagers that cannot handle things like uncensored books. The one I think is good for libraries is censored books, but in some cases that is not the best. For most cases it would be good to have censorship, because parents do not want there children reading and getting ideas from the uncensored books. Kids that are immature would not be able to handle the kind of stuff that is in uncensored books, because of how detailed they get into it. Kids will also not know what he is reading in some cases, because they use some complex words that they do not usually use or hear everyday. In some cases censored books can also not be the best choice. In many cases libraries that do not contain uncensored books are depriving them of information and realistic activities that happen today. Kids also would start asking themselves questions, and either sneak and read one of there parents or even steal it from the libraries or other stores, if they really wanted to know that bad. So either way it does not matter because kids will find a way to see it. I do believe that if some one is offended by it trhat they should take it out of there librarie. Libraries should take them out because they are not good for children, but especially if they are offensive, then they should be taken out, because it makes others feel as if they are being violated.

Many people do not wnat there kids reading things that are not good for them. Many kids that are immature should only read censored books, but if they are mature enough to handle it then I would say that they can read it.

5708,2,"Books, music, and movies for some people are ways of learning right from wrong, religous views, character, respect, or even having the ability to live in a fantasy for just a few moments before having to enter back into the life that one lives. Yes, books, movies, and music can have drawbacks, but can also have a way of showing life to people who are hidden from I love to read, and I always have. My parent's and grandparent's have always supplied me with the books, music, and movies that I have wanted. At times they have questioned what i was reading or watching, or told me they didn't think the book or movie was appropriate for a girl my age, but if i wanted to read they didn't say no. My family understood that booksor music for me were my life, they are a way for me to jump into a world and expand my imagination. However, I remember when I was in there was a book that I wanted to read 'A when I went to my library I was told I was to young to read a book with so much abusive content in and they were scared I would get ideas from the book. The thing is everyone has there reason for wanting to read a certain book, or watch a certain movie, even listening to a certain song. If you take the time in to learn how to read and there is a book you are willing to take the time on, then shouldn't be forbiden from you. There are so many good books and music in this world and I strongly disagree with the matter of taking books and music off the shelf at public libraries. Educational movies that are in liabraries were put there for a reason, they are there to learn about history and how our world got to be the way is today. Parents these days have grown away from teaching their children about responsibility, love, believing in yourself, the consequesnces of steeling, cheating and regardless not caring about others and respecting their elders. Books, music, and movies are all ways for these children to lean about life, and the joy that comes from As a teen who has had a very privilaged life when comes to books, music and movies, I really can't say I don't know compassion, I know the responsabilities that I have in life and how to respect the people I love, I know about and the religous ways that I have chosen to be apart of.

Censorship in movies also denies us the right to fully see the story and if you are wooried about kids again set guidelines on what they can and cannot see. censorship violates our right to see whats out there and censoring movies music and books denies each and everyone of us that choice to make on our own without people getting into our decision making when they should not be.

5710,2,"Libraries have such a muster of books, movies and magazines. Everybody likes different things. One person might like a magazine about cars. As another person might like to watch action films. Some people just like to read books. A library should be a place where anybody can find something they like to entertain them. We are not all the same. If you were to take out all the things in a library that are offensive, you would probably be taking out half of the library. If this were to happen there would not be much of a point to having a library. I realize that certain things be offensive to some people due to a life experence they have had. Nobody thinks of things in the same way. Some things be very offensive to most people. For some people taking something that be offensive to just one person such as a book, another person like the book and not have a problem with it. There are a lot of privalages that have been taken away just because a few people have broken the rules or in this case because someone finds a book offensive. I have personaly had a life experence that can relate to something like this. The government changed the law for what age you have to be to get your drivers liscense due to the fact of some kids who are not responsible and drive recklessly. There for they changed the age to sixteen and six months. So because of a few reckless kids our privalage to drive at sixteen is taken away and progressed six more months. Now I know it is not completely taken away and is not that big of a deal but it is progressed longer and someday the law will probably change again and be progressed even longer due to the non responsible kids. Maybe somebody likes to watch horror films, and maybe somebody does not. This be offensive in a way to some person but it should not keep someone who likes to watch horror films from watching it. Like I said we all see different things in different ways. If you find horror films offensive do not make a big deal about it and just do not watch horror films. If it there is something that is offensive to a most people then I say try to do something about it but if it is just offensive to you let it go and just forget about it",8442,8443.0,Libraries muster books  movies magazines  Everybody likes different things  One person might like magazine cars  As another person might like watch action films  Some people like read books  A library place anybody find something like entertain  We  If take things library offensive  would probably taking half library  If happen would much point library  I realize certain things offensive people due life experence  Nobody thinks things way  Some things offensive people  For people taking something offensive one person book  another person like book problem  There lot privalages taken away people broken rules case someone finds book offensive  I personaly life experence relate something like  The government changed law age get drivers liscense due fact kids responsible drive recklessly  There changed age sixteen six months  So reckless kids privalage drive sixteen taken away progressed six months  Now I know completely taken away big deal progressed longer someday law probably change progressed even longer due non responsible kids  Maybe somebody likes watch horror films  maybe somebody  This offensive way person keep someone likes watch horror films watching  Like I said see different things different ways  If find horror films offensive make big deal watch horror films  If something offensive people I say try something offensive let go forget
5711,2,"Censorship in librariaes is harsh to certain groups of people. Like some would say they have to many romance books and need more dictionaries to teach people. But to others romance novels seem to catch there interest, and makes the reader want to read so they have mental stimulations rather than being bored reading a book that doesn't catch there interest.They also have music, movies, and magazines that some doesn't apperciate being in a public place were younger library user are at trying to learn. But all it can be a good or bad thing it just depends on the library person that using the items. Books can being very educational to learn from, or it can be interesting to read depending on the reader. Some would say that romance novels shouldn't be in a public place. Lots of people find reading a romance novel can be very interesting and mind stimulate. They might not like reading mysteries or adventure books, but something that catches there eye. But the parents that take the younger children there might think other wise. Seeing there child picking up a book that might be to mature for them to see or asking there parents what does such and such means. Can have a tole on parents. But one would say they should be watching where their child is going so they won't have to see those 'types' of books. Movies can be harsh in certain enthic groups to see, but at the same time it teaches a very valuable lesson. From my own experience when I was in middle school my social studies class was doing a lesson on slavery. The lesson included items like how slaves was treated, where they lived at, where they had to work at, and indoor/outdoor slaves and how one had special treatment than the other because one was lighter. So the most perfect movie to show at the end of the lesson was the world famous movie '@CAPS1'. It taught us students how life was like before the But some parents didn't want they child to witness what had happen to people and how came here in the The film even showed how hundreds of dying before they even arrived to and them throwing them over board because they was useless. I can see why parent didn't want their child to see that kind of film. But it still taught a lessson to children, it taught how racism is so degrading that another human being is so selfish that they would kill another human being just so they can do chores around the house and not get paid or a simple thank you. Magazines can be more an adult and teenage thing than rather younger child. The children can rip the magazine and the guardian would have to pay for the item. Magazines aren't bad it just might depend on what in the magazine. Such as things that involve sex. Children shouldn't be introduce to sex not yet, because they can go back and tell their other classmates what they have learned from this magazine. They might go back and tell their moms or dads, the parents start to negative about parents, and why are they letting their six year son read this. Magazines can be very entertaining too read. With all of the bright pictures, color fonts, and new trends that are out now. So in conclusion, books can be very mind stimulate to adults, but mother and fathers or children find it disrespectful to have romance books in a place of learning. is a very educational movie to watch but can be to graphic for younger child to watch that's in middle school.

5712,2,"Cenorship in the I think that libraries should have censorship do to young children and teens. A few reasons I think this is because young children should not be able to see disturbing things, also it could teach teens harmful and horrible things depending on what the book is about, and these books should be in a restricted area for adults only. I don't think that children should be able to see the things that adults read. These things could be harmful for the child to see and could cause them to learn things they shouldn't until they are older. Although they be interested in them it isn't always appropriate for their age group. If we just let the children look at any book they want to see or read this could cause bad things. They could learn things they don't need to know at the age they are at and also see things they don't need to. Another reason that I think that libraries should have good censorship is because some books have some very groosom violent things in them that could teach young teens to do. Such as the books about killings, bombings, suicides, rape, etc. I don't think that immature teens should be able to read these books without a parents permission. I don't think that people realize that people get ideas from books. I'm not trying to say that everybody does things because of books but if you think about it be a cause. The last reason I think that good censorship should in libraries is because there are somethings that people shouldn't have to see.I think there should be an area in the where you have to have a card to get in. The age limit should be eightteen without parents permission, and fourteen to sixteen should have parents permission. This doesn't have to have all the books in it but the ones that they don't think are very appropriate for certain ages to see or read should be. In conclusion, the main three reasons I think that libraries should have good cenorship is young children don't need to see this, could teach teens violent things, and adults and with parents permission fourteen to sixteen year olds should be able to see these things.

Why because so many kids such as teens and parents love going to the library and picking up a good book and music that they just love to hear or read. So if you ask me no that stuff should not be taking off the shelves because if they get rid of everything then they wont have people come to there library anymore. Instead they will just get online to listen to music or they will go to a certain place like a mall and just by the book they want. The kids will also do the same they will just go out and buy it themself instead of going to a library just because they didnt have the book or etc that they unfortunatley that they got rid of.

5715,2,"As every student moves on further through their life in education, they will all eventually come across subject material that be inapropriate for when they were younger. They are now though mature and responsible enough to handle it. If libraries remove these subjects, then they are just taking away the opertunity for one to become more educated of the real world. Many students depend on the library to find information needed for studies. It becomes annoying that certain material cannot be found just because it is not appropriate or be offensive to some people. Small children aren't the only ones going to the library, and they wouldn't be looking at something they're not allowed to look at anyway. If this is a big problem, then there needs to be an age limit on what you can check out. Everyone else would be fine though. This would make it fair to everybody. The world isn't a perfect place. There are many things that people find offensive and try to ignore. The purpose of the library is to teach people about the world. We cannot just exclude certain things because some people don't like it; everyone needs to know about these things eventually. It not always be pleasant, but they need to be in the library so we can know. Censoring a library would just be like censoring the lives of many people who rely on the library for their knowledge. Before long, the government would become more and more strict about what is allowed in a library. After a while, many books, magazines, and movies would disapear because of this. Eventually no more new information would be added, and people could no longer learn more than what they know. It's human nature to do more of something once it is started. We will always be thinking that the library is not censored enough and therefore, we would take out more sources. This issue will always be present, and we have to realize there is no real way to get rid of it. The best solution is to let the library hold onto all of its resorces, so they can be there to help us better understand the world. If people still find some material offensive, then they don't have to look at it. This way, it is also there for those people who don't have a problem with it.

5716,2,"Do you ever feel like that some things shouldnt belong? Like books in a local library, that seem a little uncalled for, or doesnt appeal to your liking and you disapprove of it? In my opinion i believe that all books in the libraries should stay. I think that everyone has a right to know and increase their knowledge by reading about other things. Some things seem like they shouldn't be there for children to read or for people to use the information if, in a wrongly manner. I believe that the books that have cultural backgrounds and past religions should be admitted to libraries. It gives students and children a positive outlook on how past generations or years have been and can increase their knowledge. If libraries are places of information and knowledge, why band it from these places, when all it has done is help us learn. I think the wide variety of books and topics are great for people wanting to seek out more than just one topic and do something different in the world. Some books or magazines might even give a young person inspiration to do something better. I have looked in many books and became inspired to try new things and be a better person. These things can also have a positive effect on older people as well. For older people books in the library can give them inspiration and help them know who they really are. A person can find out more on their ancestory and religion through books. The books aren't the only thing that im worried about. Music and movies can also be a good source of information for one to use. Although they might not be as accurate as books they still play a huge role in education and understanding. Many people think that the books and other resources are offensive. These books aren't put in libraries to hurt anyones feelings or discourage a person. Its there to give people a true and logical understanding. Not all books can be harmful to one's feelings. There are many other books to choose from. Like biographies, romance, comedy, and even childrens books. If these things were meant to be offensive why would anyone put them on public display for everyone to see? Libraries are for learners, and anyone who would sabatage the place of knoweldge are not a true learner themselves.

That the mom or dad was to let there kid see. These books have meaning in them and have words but I like really they need to be there to really see how the book is in all and good ideas that might not like and all. Now going on to the music yea same libraries have music parts and same dont but they have all different music in there and same they willn't like I will say is the rock and hip hop. The movies same have parts kids dont need to see, the same as magazines parts kids dont need to see but I can say to that there are same movies kids can watch and they will be good for them, now the etc. thing are I will say is a reading book or renting a computer. They other thing is to that the parents got something. They went to watch or a book they went to look at or a magazine. They looking at it and all or they are watching it and here cames the kids in was to lay with them and they said yes so they cann't watch they movie no more now. My thing about it is to watch the movie and strat it when you know your kid is asleep and no never let your kid watch movies they dont need to or scary ones and they dont need to hear same language thats in the movies to. They thing I just strated talking about was the language no your kids or no ones kids should be over bad laguage. You know what I mean there. So I really think if you going to watch something with not good stuff on it or bad language in it I will watch it with my kids out or keep it quite it so they can't hear it. I really do still like that they need to keep all books, movies, music, magazines, and all the etc in the libraries.

Kids should not be able to just pick these up whenever they want. If minors can't buy or magazines that have the same images in a store without proof of or parent permission they shouldn't be able to get them at a public library. If libraries want to have movies and magazines that have pictures to inapropriate for children they need to seperate them from the books and movies that are meant for kids. The libraries should make another room or section off a corner that has these magazines and movies. They also should have someone check for before letting anyone go in there.

5720,2,"Do you think that certain materials should be removed from shelves at a library if they are offensive? Some people believe that certain movies, books, music, etc. should not even be aloud to be bought or checked out. People need to understand that even though they find certain things offensive, others not. I find that even though people find some reading/video materials offensive, they should not be removed from the shelves at a library. Everybody likes different things, rather it be drama, comody, sports, horror, etc.,@CAPS1 you go to a library there is usually different sections for each of these topics. Some people worry about there kids accidently going to the wrong isle, and grabing a book or movie that is inapropriate for them. In this case maybe suggest to the librarian that you feel insecure about the way they have the library set up and maybe suggest that they move all the scary movies and books to there own section of the library so that the items don't accidently get moved to the kids isle, or even maybe just suggest putting big colorful signs up of the different topics of the items so that they are easy to find and they pop out where everyone will see them. Also with having seperate areas in the library there are benefits for kids. If there was a kids section, the kids could be over in there section while the parents go over to the adult section of the library and get what they need while their kids are getting what they need, then they won't have to worry about their kids ending up seeing something they're not aloud to be seeing. Teens these days try and get away with things they are not aloud to get away with, and they're always up for breaking rules. To check an rated movie or book out of the library you should have to be eighteen. In this case anyone who is trying to check out a book or movies that is rated the librarian should ask to see some kind of identification to prove that they're eighteen. If someone comes in and wants to check something out that is rated and they don't have identification they should not get to check the item out.

Finally will be some observations about them. Now I am going to tell about some readings. First of all, there are many readings about offensive things.

There is no reason for them to do so, because all people have different opinions. Now it is my experiences.

It is just the way that I have grown up, that I get what other people think. Like I have already said, people have different opinions. There are also some observations on these offensive things. Finally, observations are a very important roll in this opinion. There are observation sheets that some libraries have, that have people say whether they like the offensive things or not. In my opinion, they should not have those sheets. Even though you have people voting, those sheets still wouldn't be very accurate. That reason is that there are some offensive books that people don't mind, and then other offensive books that people do mind. This means that if the libraries did get rid of them, then they wouldn't really know which books to clear off the shelves.

5725,2,"Should offensive books be taken off the shelves? Do we have to worry about little children reading these books? I beileve that every book needs to stay in the library. Should little children be allowed to read those books, absolutly not. Offensive books should not be removed because a couple of worried mothers say so. Offensive materials are apart of everyday life and sooner or later children will grow up. Offensive materials are extremly not for children but taking them out of a library limits the usage for another grown adults. Offensive materials do have a place in the library maybe not in the childrens section but a place. Usally libraries have a place for children. These 'children's books only' areas help restrict your child from reading something offensive. Most libraries have big sections that are just for children too. If your library does not have one of these sections then talk to them. Ask your local librarian to open a children's area. Most libraries do not even allow a child to have a library card and if you do not really trust your child then you might not even want to give him/her a card anyways. You can always go with your child to pick up a book or magazine just to make sure it's not rude or offensive. You could also pick up a book yourself so you would not have to worry. As I have stated if we took offensive books off the shelves what would adults read? There would be no fair justice to the other part of the libraries people. I understand that no one wants their child reading something with rude behavior or offensive actions, but would a single woman/man with no children like that idea? No. We have to keep all the materials the library has to make it fair to everyone.

Although some people say that these things are good for children to read, they should be taken off the shelves because they cause the child to think its right to do the same things the characters in the stories are doing, it give a child the wrong ideas, and it make the child want to act like a certain person because their friends are acting like that too. Most people have there different oppions about all the different shows or magazines that in the world today. Some people probably think its fine to let their kids wear whatever they want cause they think its better for them. Just because other people are doing it cause you to think that you should just so you can fit it. Thats not the case here. Children think that its fine to do what the characters are doing in their favorite stories or magazines, but their parents might have a different view on it. Just like some magazines the talk about to get a certain guy to like you and you have to wear 'cooler' low cut shirts and stuff like that. The childs parents are not just going to go out and buy their kids things that are not suitable to their likings. That is one reasoning behind why some books, or magazines should be taken off the shelves. Another reasoning behind this is because it could cause the child to get the wrong ideas about other people. Just like in the book '@CAPS1 where they give the black people a hard time just because they are a different color than them. This cause a child to think that white people are the best out of everyone in the world. Another idea children can get from books or magazines is that your only going to be pretty if you wear certain types of makeup or name brand clothes. Which is very bad for littler kids. That is a second reasoning behind why some books or magazines should be taken off the shelves. The third and final reasoning why these different books and/or magazines should be taken off is because it think its cool to act like a famous person cause their friends are doing the same thing. Just like when the '@CAPS3 came on everyone want to do the poof and be just like Just like that shows can also cause kids to think that its ok to go out and party. While doing all the other things these shows are showing kids. Also these shows like 'The cause kids that are not so skinny to think that they arent good enough cause they are 'bigger' than the other kids at school. That is my final reasoning behind why they should take certain books, magazines, movies, and etc. off the shelves. Even seeing these different reasonings cause you not to want your child seeing these different shows or magazines. Being able to control your child and watching what they are doing is way better than just leaveing your child do what ever they want.

From my observations I can see that there is alot of fowl languge in music, books, movies, etc. This gives kids a bad imige of the right things to say and do. If there is censorship in place it would make things easier for parents to control what their child is listening to, reading or seeing on and in movies. For example in movies there is bad language and thing being done like smoking. If kids see their favorite movie stare or idol doing it then they think it is ok to copy this same bad behavior. Kids are subject to alot of things that they shouldn't have be subject to. So if schools and libraries can prevent a little of the bad things that they see why not have censorship in place. Some parents let their kids see, listen to and read what ever they want and that is just their way of parenting.

When I take time and think about it, different books appeal to different types of people. The ones that look drab and boring to me might be ones that others would be dying to open up the first page.

Alot of authors write their books on real life experiences and some people take them in offense because they don't take the time to appreciate the hard work of the author. They jump to conclusions and automatically take some of the statements personally. The goal of an author is to paint a visual picture in your head and make you seem like you're virtually there.

5729,2,"Have you ever watched a movie that you absolutely loved and your parents hated? This is because you and your parent have a different opinion on things. Your parents might of thought that the movie was inappropriate for many reasons. You, on the other hand, loved it and thought that everything in the movie was fine. The movie seemed to offend your parents, or made them feel uncomfortable. In this day and age, I think that forms of media and entertainment depend upon the age of the person experiencing it and the place it is being sold or viewed. A public library has all the books, magazines, movies, and music you could want. The public library has things that has to interest all types of people. It could not only try to appeal to a certain group of people and just what those people want. Libraries should not have extremely inappropriate things that would offend people on their shelves, but if there is some bad language in a book or movie, it should not become a huge issue. I believe that everyone can like whatever they want, and it should be available for their use. School libraries is a different story. School libraries have to have appropriate books and movies in them. Every school library will be different depending on the type of school. Elementary schools should have absolutely no inappropriate things that could make the parents of young children be offended. Middle schools and high schools seem to have books that are somewhat inappropriate, but are not to extreme that they should not be in a school library. In my class, we all just finished reading 'To a and one of the main conflicts was racism. This topic could have offended someone. Although, we learned how prejudices are wrong. Just like pre-judging a book because you saw the cover or read the back. The book might talk about something you are completely against, but it might show you something else you thought would never be hidden beneath. I believe that certain books, movies, music, and magazines have a certain time, place, and group of people they affect.

5730,2,"Some people believe that offensive books should be removed from library shelves. I do not agree with this. While I do agree that some books are not suitable for children, removing them from the shelves does not solve the problem. We live in a world today where children are exposed to inappropriate movies, commercials, computer images, and even the television news at a young age. If parents wish to protect their children from such things, removing library books will not quite do the trick. Ok, so they won't read offensive material, but they will certainly be exposed to it elsewhere. Unfortunately, in today's world, protecting a child from inappropriate content would be like holding back the ocean with a broom. Now, what do I suggest be done about this problem? Mark inappropriate books and stick them on a higher shelf. It is a simple solution. Being marked with a sticker or some sort of indication, would allow parents or the librarian to suggest a different book to the child who is trying to check out the inappropriate one. The system would serve as a parental warning, similar to movie ratings or Also, with the books on a higher shelf, the children would be less likely to pick up the book in the first place. As a child I was always reading way beyond my age level. I loved books and would read anything I could get my hands on. In elementary, I would go to our highschool library to recieve a challenge. One particular time, I remeber trying to check out a book. If I am not mistaken it was '@CAPS2 with the The librarian looked at me with a funny look on her face. Then chuckled and said, 'I don't suggest you read this until you're older.' I nodded, returned the book to it's proper place, and left. I was angry. I felt insulted. '@CAPS4 knows I'm a good reader! I could've read that book easily,' I thought to myself. To this day, I have not read the book. I know what it's about now, but I have never actually read it. However, I believe the librarian knew I could read the book. In her eyes, that was the problem. didn't want me to read and understand some of the stuff in the book. My point is, children will always try to pick up inappropriate books, unknowingly. If the book had been marked as inappropriate and placed on a higher shelf, I would not have attempted to check it out. Perhaps some people believe that adults should not be reading these books either. Mature adults are able to make that choice, and if they are reading a book that they find offensive, they can simply put it down.

Don't wine and complain that there is something you don't like in it than simply don't get it! People sometimes trys to argue about racial stuff being in books or movies. Those movies were made to show something. They were made to show how it was like. Do you think they make movies like that to be racist. I don't think so. There is another point of view from me. Now like real grusome movies like real gory and nasty. Those movies shouldn't be removed either. For pretty much the same reason. If people are complaining about that. Well they shouldn't at all because they don't have to watch those movies. Some people like those movies alot and some people can't stand stuff like that. They're made for peoples entertainment right? Well it should stay like that. You really just can't take entertaiment of the shelves like that. People also lose money if you take that kind of entertainment. Like i was saying.

They read them to show people the greater outspect of life. All i hear about how bad this was how bad that was. Don't watch it, or read it if you don't like it! Most people shouldn't care about it thats my observation over this whole ordeal. Alot of people in this century watch, or read that kind of stuff. Now if you take all good entertainment of the shelve thats going to make people mad. Who cares about those people that want it off the shelve.

Making the right decision is also very important as you grow more independent. Choosing to wear a pair of shorts when it is snowing outside is an example of a bad decision, however putting on some pants and a coat would obviously be the right thing to do. It goes the same for picking a book, music, movie, or magazine. If you know that the object is inappropriate for your age group then you should not choose it. Making smart decisions everyday can make you an all around better person. In my opinion, I think that the option of offensive materials should be available for those who wish to read or listen to them. However, the materials should be marked with a sticker or put in a different section to indicate them. Children picking out a book should be told not to enter a certain section that has offensive or imature books in it. Removing these books from the shelves would be limiting our choices which would be limiting our experience as decision makers. I have observed in a movie store where they have put rated movies in a different section than the rated movies. Showing people their options is a good way to form them into a good decision maker. If a person wishes to watch a rated movie, then I think that they should be allowed to make that mistake for themselves. My goal is to help better people in their decision making skills, I thought a good way to do this was to put this article in my local newspaper.

5734,2,"Do I believe that certain media, such as books, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves because they are offensive? No I do not. For several reasons: freedom of speech, freedom of opinion, and it can harm the education process. Now it is widely known that everyone's views and opinions are different are different. So you should not remove a piece of media from the shelf because someone feels that it is offensive; because, even though they feel it's offensive to them someone else not belive the same way they do. If the person feels that a piece of media is offensive to them then they should not read and/or watch it, because there are people in the world that do not feel that it is offensive and removing it from the shelves of the public prevents that person from enjoying that piece of media. Secondly, as a country, we have freedom of speech and the right to express our opinion. So if a piece of media is removed from shelves then it is a violation of the the right to have freedom of speech. The removal of media, because there are individuals that view it as offensive, is the equivilant of questioning the So removing media in the serves as a problem, but in other countries it not. So for example, if someone writes a book that others feel is offensive, then those who find the material to be offensive have the right not to read that book because the author has the freedom to write about whatever he or she pleases. Lastly, there are books and movies that can be educational and offensive. Removal of such media can hinder one's education. This removal can prevent someone from learning about something important such as the Right or when there were slaves because someone said it was offensive to their race and wanted the books and movies to be removed. Then if this happened the majority of the media will never reach the shelves because it is viewed as offensive, and we as people would be uneducated about so many subjects. Should media be removed from the shelves because it is found to be offensive? No. The we have the right of freedom of speech and the right to express ourselves freely and those who don't agree with my opinions or your opinions do not have to listen.

The censorship of these items should be at the discretion of the owner, and the owner of that establishment only. If people do not want to see certain items, they do not have to enter. They have the right to walk or look away. Censorship in a library takes away the rights of a person. If a person wants to view certain materials disliked by others, they should be able to. No one should be able to say is and is not allowed to be viewed in a public library. If you take away things that offend people then you might as well not even have a library because everyone is offended by different things. When you walk into those places and see books, magazines, movies, and music you don't like you can walk the other way or find you want in there and go on your way. If somebody else doesn't approve, it doesn't mean that their voice is the only one heard. Everyone is opinionated in their views, so censorship in a library doesn't see like a swell idea. Once while I was in my family and I walked into a rather large library to go check out their selections. My brother and I wanted to check out some of the new music from but we couldn't because you had to be eighteen to enter the music section of the library. That angered my brother and I greatly. I didn't really understand why we couldn't go back there. Our parents let us listen to the music, and they said that we could go back there, but the store policy was you had to be eighteen. Big deal, we weren't eighteen, but it's not like it was anything new to us. That instance in that library made me realize that other people shouldn't have to right to say I can and cannot view. That is one reason why cencorship frustrates me. Now that I am sixteen, I am allowed to view most things I want to in a library, but there are still a few things that I cannot view. I walked into a library a couple of weeks ago in downtown to check out some of their new selections. When I walked in, I saw a few boys arguing with the manager. As i walked by, I heard that the boys were frustrated that they couldn't enter the movie section because you had to be at least thirteen to view the movies. They, like I did before, didn't understand why. '@CAPS3's the big deal?' one boy asked. The big deal is censorship. Because of censorship that one boy and his friends couldn't see movies most of our parents would let us watch. That was another moment in my life that I realized I wasn't the biggest fan of censorship. That is my view of censorship in libraries. It not be most people want to hear, but hey it's my opinion. I believe that you should have the right to see you want. If not, why are we a free country? Censorship in most cases, causes unwanted problems and makes people angry, but yet there is still censorship in most places. If the person can enter the place, they should have the right to view anything in that establishment.

5740,2,"In todays world we have a lot of censorship surrounding us. As teenagers we are still shrouded from certain movies and video games. These ratings have a very real tactic to them. With these movies they have vugarity or violence with real people, can put children under the belief that these actions in the movies are real and not makebelieve. But, in today's society is sensoring our books going a little off the deep end? These books have titles, descriptions and are even separated into sections like childrens, fantasy, junior, young adult, and adult. With these sections is it not enough to restrict what children and teens are reading? First and foremost I feel that blocking out what any parent feels is inapropriate should be just that, the parents job. When parents have the choice they can choose what they feel is appropriate for their child. If, on the other hand, parents choose not to watch what their children are checking out at the library, then so be it. It be irresponsible, but sooner or later the parents will notice that their child is reading The in the at the age of 'because it had to do with a in pajams.' should have been realized and taken care of by the parents, the government should not have to step in to stop children from reading certain books. Along with parents watching, libraries everywhere are separated by different sections. In my local library there are completely different sides of the library to keep children away from the 'grownup' books, as I used to say. These sections are then further broken up into subcategories. On the kids side of the library there are junior books and childrens books. The childrens are on tiny shelves with bright colors, the juniors books recieve a more official placement on respectable shelves and actually go by the I feel that is also sufficient because the children will take to the bright books with colorful pictures on each page .While the preteens will find a good book in the tall shelves of the junior section. across the library we have the young adult and adult books. these adult books I personally find to be uninteresting because they are mostly about science or non-fiction. Though occasionally my eye will wonder to the shelves lined with old classics. There is not much in a library to be sensored, in any respectable library you would not find a book packed with vulgarity and crude jokes. The teen section is another world though because the advanced junior reader stray to the other side. However, they should have their parents with them at the checkout desk because they cannot very well leave with out them, afterall, they cannot drive. A few examples of very sketchy books seem to be the ones that push the walls of religion. Of course I am refering to the famous books such as The of and the like. Parents are successfully sensoring against these books because they see a problem with them. It is a perfect example of the very thing I find to be effective.These books are in the young adult section though they are listed as junior fiction because of the good versus evil factor mostly. It is very surreal and some beloved people die, a reasonable answer for not letting a nine year old read these books. I find absolutley no reason for the government to step in and advocate for sensorship on our books and literature. It be unfit for some readers but the book was placed into a certain category to keep little hands away from earth shaking ideas such as magic, war, and death. The parents of children will always play a big role in their child's life and hopefully that is one of the aspects they keep in touch with, what their child is reading",8502,8503.0,In todays world lot censorship surrounding us  As teenagers still shrouded certain movies video games  These ratings real tactic  With movies vugarity violence real people  put children belief actions movies real makebelieve  But  today s society sensoring books going little deep end  These books titles  descriptions even separated sections like childrens  fantasy  junior  young adult  adult  With sections enough restrict children teens reading  First foremost I feel blocking parent feels inapropriate  parents job  When parents choice choose feel appropriate child  If  hand  parents choose watch children checking library   It irresponsible  sooner later parents notice child reading The age because pajams   realized taken care parents  government step stop children reading certain books  Along parents watching  libraries everywhere separated different sections  In local library completely different sides library keep children away grownup  books  I used say  These sections broken subcategories  On kids side library junior books childrens books  The childrens tiny shelves bright colors  juniors books recieve official placement respectable shelves actually go I feel also sufficient children take bright books colorful pictures page While preteens find good book tall shelves junior section  across library young adult adult books  adult books I personally find uninteresting mostly science nonfiction  Though occasionally eye wonder shelves lined old classics  There much library sensored  respectable library would find book packed vulgarity crude jokes  The teen section another world though advanced junior reader stray side  However  parents checkout desk well leave  afterall  drive  A examples sketchy books seem ones push walls religion  Of course I refering famous books The like  Parents successfully sensoring books see problem  It perfect example thing I find effectiveThese books young adult section though listed junior fiction good versus evil factor mostly  It surreal beloved people die  reasonable answer letting nine year old read books  I find absolutley reason government step advocate sensorship books literature  It unfit readers book placed certain category keep little hands away earth shaking ideas magic  war  death  The parents children always play big role child s life hopefully one aspects keep touch  child reading

Yes, there is material found in 'certain sections' of the library that is inappropriate for people under a certain age, but that is why we have labels and ratings on the spine of books and covers of music cases to inform us of this.

Now having matured, my liking for certain books has disolved, while my interest for others has increased. By removing books, music, movies, magazines and other materials that be found 'offensive' to certain people is wrong. Not everyone shares the same views on what is or is not appropriate.

Sometimes it is not necessary to censor some of the words in the songs. People should be allowed to make whatever song they want to make. The library does not have to support their music.

5746,2,"Censorship in public libraries, where do you stand? I believe that there should be no cencorship in public libraries. It should be the job of the parent to decide whether or not they want their children reading or watching certain material. Cencorship will not stop kids from seeing and hearing what their parents don't want them to hear. They're going to see violence and hear profanity, whether it's on television, at school, in a magazine. It's inevitable. Removing from the shelves all the books, and magazines that are offensive is something I do not agree with. It should be the objective of the reader to decide whether or not they want to read certain materials. If someone were to read a book or magazine, and they were somehow offended by the reading material, I believe they wouldn't continue to read it. But someone will enjoy that literature, and that's why offensive material shouldn't be removed. In my own expierence I have found the more offensive reading material to be the most enjoyable. They're more realistic, and when I read a book I need to be able to relate to it. I read a book, in eighth grade. I found it on the shelf at my school, it was about a boy who made a bet with his friends to see who would lose their virginity first. It was full of profanity, graphic details, and violence, but it was something I could relate to. The things he did with his friends, the way he thought and talked, it was easy to relate to. Some people would have found the book offensive, but I enjoyed it because it was realistic.

5747,2,"Censorship in Libraries I think they should not have censorship on books, music, movies, or magazines in libraries. When people go to the library, they should know what kind of material they want and if they are mature enough to read it. It's not anybody else's choice, if they want it, then they will take it own their own. One reason I don't think they need to take censorship out of libraries is because people are responsible for taking what they would like to. If you know that it will have offensive language in it, then you know not pick it up, and check it out. At libraries you can always look at the material before you leave the library, and if you don't like it, then you have the choice to put it back on the shelf and go find something different that you would like to check out. Another reason is that if younger kids go to the library and want to check something out, they should have their parent go with them, and make sure the item they chose is right for them to borrow for the time period the library allows. This way the parent is responsible for letting their child borrow the library's book. So if the parent says it's alright, then they should not have any problems with what is in the library. The last reason is that sometimes authors make books that have offensive language in it because sometimes its just what they want to put in their books. Also, artists have offensive language in a lot of songs, and if your not mature enough to handle it, then that's why the artist make songs that are censored. So again it's your choice if you would like to read the author's book or listen to the artist's songs. In conclusion, I don't think that libraries need to take censorship out of their materials. Its just up to the people to choose the right book or magazine that they would like to read without getting offended. It's also up to people to choose the right music that fits their style and what they would like to listen to. I mean if there is something that has offensive language, you can always go somewhere else, or even in the same library that does have censorship in it.

5748,2,"The subject of whether or not books, movies, magazines, along with other items offered at the library should be removed or not can be seen through many different views. One be that if the book is not found offensive to everyone then it should be able to be offered on the shelves. Another could be viewed as if the item has content that could be offensive to generally everyone, especially to kids, should be removed or withdrawn out of the library. Typically, libraries are seperated off into sections either by age or by genre. So if one has a problem with a certain book or an other material, they then have the choice to avoid the section the book and other books like it can be found in. There are several more reasonable solutions to the problem rather than to just take the book out of the library and not even offering the choice for someone who does not find it offensive to read it. That statement has an example, by offering the in the library, an atheistic person find that sort of literature offensive to them, but to not offer it at all, offend a or someone who would like to study it. The major problem with just getting rid of the book or other material in the library, restricts those who do not find it offensive from expanding their mind set on such things. I can agree with on how some people would not want to find an item referring to the topics of sex or drugs in areas where younger children wander, but typically that is not the case. Most libraries are very careful about where they put items containing such topics. I come to that conclusion, because younger children and sometimes even teens should not be exposed to harmful things like that at a younger age; those problems are usely involved with older people anyways. Also, that opinion is typically shared throughout our society, this expressed in on how we rate movies that are presented movie theatres throughout our nation. But to restrict on a religious or scientific belief is unjustified here. Let us not forget that we are a free country and are intitled to a freedom of choice. We should not deny anyone their opportunity to learn about a subject they choose to. Therefore, by removing whatever item only you and a few others find offensive and unneeded in a library, try to flip the situation around and ask yourself how you would feel if some stranger was denying you the option. As for a concern on what younger kids be picking up on in libraries is not a large issue. The parents of younger children usually monitor their children in what they are listening to and/or reading. Some people should become more open minded on the fact that not everyone has the same shared belief that they might have. So, the next time you enter your local library scene, try to be a little more excepting to other people's opinions, beliefs, and interrests.

Then again, some will not because they find certain ones offenssive. If they are offensive to certain people then take them off of the shelves. Let's take a second to think about what could happen if you don't. You be sued, people would be out of jobs, and your product would not be bought. Do we really want that to happen? No, we don't now I will explain how all of this is possible. Most people who feel that they are offended will take action. Meaning you just might end up being sued by him or her. Now there's a chance you loose, so now you have to come out of your pocket and give money just because someone took something you're selling the wrong way. We know that it is not your fault. We also know that you didn't make it, but it's your store so they sue you. If it was music they were selling then most artist would be out of a job. Based on experiences as a child I know that when we feel something is offensive, we don't like it. Artist we don't like, don't get listened to. There goes somebody's job. I know that when you're a famous music artist, you have to sell a certain amount of copies. If you don't then your out of business. If offensive things to certain people are found on shelves then people will not buy them. It will just sit there taking up space and eventually be thrown out. They will also tell their friends. Since friends most likely have a lot in common, it will be offensive to them too. Now you have just upset your customers and your products will not be bought. You will eventually go out of business. Looks like now you are also out of a job. Not only that, but you will have a lot of angry customers running around your store. In conclusion, lots of things can happen just by offending someone.

5750,2,"As the society continues to grow and controversial subjects become more accepted, children in this generation and future generations are more exposed to the flaws in society. How is this you ask? Well, subjects such as drugs, sex, and alcohol can be seen everywhere from magazines, television commercials, and even books. Children are growing up faster and learning about subjects that they shouldn't even be thinking about until they are much older. However, as society becomes more comfortable with risque commercials and magazines advertising sex the more it will continue to go on and it even get worse. As each generation continues to grow the faster they continue to grow up. Even though this is inevitable, kids shouldn't be growing up even quicker as they are exposed to adult subjects through books and magazines. Many kids visit the library and they have access to these adult themed books. This shouldn't be allowed nor accepted. In conclusion, the books and magazines deemed not appropriate should be put in a restricted section where they will not be allowed to check out these items without parental consent. As a young adult, I've been exposed to many adult subjects through magazines, and even books. I remember as a child walking through my small town library and seeing risque models on the front's of magazines and I remember picking up books with suggestive pictures. Although these didn't affect the way I grew up and my way of thinking, it affect another child differently. I was lucky enough to have parents who educated me on such adult subjects but what about other kids who don't have that. Once, when in my town library, I picked up a magazine and was curious as to why there was a half-naked women on the front. Looking through it, I read words that I had never heard before. The next day at school, I asked a fellow classmate what these unknown words were (which of course were not school appropriate) and was overheard by my teacher. I was sent to the principals office all because the library let people of all ages have access to these clearly not age appropriate books and magazines. Through that experience, it solidifies why there should be seperate sections of books that are not allowed to be accessed by children of a certain age. I've grown up with several close friends with younger siblings and it baffles how much they know at such young age about sex, drugs, and alcohol. As a fifth grader I never dreamed of knowing what they knew. However, it all goes back to the fact that kids are simply more exposed to adult subjects as the society grows. These books and magazines shouldn't be placed in a library where kids have access. The library is supposed to be considered an educational place but what exactly do you want kids to be educated on. The more I'm around younger children, the more I see how society has affected them. Children are constantly exposed to adult subjects being glorified through books and magazines. When talking to young kids, they talk about sex, drugs, and alcohol as if they are no big deal. They've seen it almost everyday and have almost become comfortable with it. Do we honestly want our kids being exposed at a library that has always been thought of as educational? As I've gotten older, I've paid more attention to the news and newspapers. It's sad opening up a newspaper and reading about bullying or underage drinking or even teen pregnancy. However, after sitting and thinking about it, shows and magazines have glorified such things and have almost made it the cool thing to do. Research and statistics show the affects of children being more exposed by the signifigant amount of more kids getting violent, pregnant or even arrested. So I must ask. Why are we allowing such exposure to go on? Kids are going to be exposed no matter what but is it really necessary at a public library? If we could make a little bit of a difference in a child's life, then it would be worth the change of the way the library is ran. Let's improve our community and try to at least help keep kids out of trouble. In conclusion, through my own experiences, observations, and reading I have solidified my argument that children should not have access to books and magazines with adult subjects in public libraries. When children have become young adults then yes, they make their own decisions on what they should or shouldn't read but should we really be exposing children? I think not. Through sensoring books and magazines that children check out, it will in a small way, help improve our already damaged society",8522,8523.0,As society continues grow controversial subjects become accepted  children generation future generations exposed flaws society  How ask  Well  subjects drugs  sex  alcohol seen everywhere magazines  television commercials  even books  Children growing faster learning subjects nt even thinking much older  However  society becomes comfortable risque commercials magazines advertising sex continue go even get worse  As generation continues grow faster continue grow  Even though inevitable  kids nt growing even quicker exposed adult subjects books magazines  Many kids visit library access adult themed books  This nt allowed accepted  In conclusion  books magazines deemed appropriate put restricted section allowed check items without parental consent  As young adult  I ve exposed many adult subjects magazines  even books  I remember child walking small town library seeing risque models front s magazines I remember picking books suggestive pictures  Although nt affect way I grew way thinking  affect another child differently  I lucky enough parents educated adult subjects kids nt  Once  town library  I picked magazine curious halfnaked women front  Looking  I read words I never heard  The next day school  I asked fellow classmate unknown words  course school appropriate  overheard teacher  I sent principals office library let people ages access clearly age appropriate books magazines  Through experience  solidifies seperate sections books allowed accessed children certain age  I ve grown several close friends younger siblings baffles much know young age sex  drugs  alcohol  As fifth grader I never dreamed knowing knew  However  goes back fact kids simply exposed adult subjects society grows  These books magazines nt placed library kids access  The library supposed considered educational place exactly want kids educated  The I m around younger children  I see society affected  Children constantly exposed adult subjects glorified books magazines  When talking young kids  talk sex  drugs  alcohol big deal  They ve seen almost everyday almost become comfortable  Do honestly want kids exposed library always thought educational  As I ve gotten older  I ve paid attention news newspapers  It s sad opening newspaper reading bullying underage drinking even teen pregnancy  However  sitting thinking  shows magazines glorified things almost made cool thing  Research statistics show affects children exposed signifigant amount kids getting violent  pregnant even arrested  So I must ask  Why allowing exposure go  Kids going exposed matter really necessary public library  If could make little bit difference child s life  would worth change way library ran  Let s improve community try least help keep kids trouble  In conclusion  experiences  observations  reading I solidified argument children access books magazines adult subjects public libraries  When children become young adults yes  make decisions nt read really exposing children  I think  Through sensoring books magazines children check  small way  help improve already damaged society

5752,2,"In my opinion, censorship in libraries is an awful idea. Information should be free. If people can't get certain information from libraries, they're going to have to pay for it. One of the laws our country was founded on is freedom of speech. The opinions of authors written in library books are an example of those authors excercising their right to free speech. All through school, adolescents learn that reading is supposed to be fun and educational. If some ideas and subjects are removed from library books, it is possible that some people might loose interest in books completely. In my opinion, no one should ever have information kept from them for any reason. People use libraries to gather news, to study, and even for religious purposes. If the topics these people are looking for are banned from libraries, where will they find this information? Some people can't afford to buy books. Those who can't afford books might remain completely ignorant about a specific subject for their entire lives. Every person in the is entitled to freedom of speech. Libraries hold the thoughts and opinions of many different authors. To take away the ideas of certain authors is to take away their free speech, which goes against one of the oldest principals of our country. Also, the books people read are a form of expression. To ban specific books would be taking away those readers' right to expression as well. Students today are taught, throughout their lives, that reading can be fun and educational for everyone. There are so many books on almost every subject that anyone should be able to find one to interest him or her. When some subjects are taken away, some people might loose interest in books. With less people reading, literacy rates would decline. The population would become less educated, and ignorant people are always a negative. If very few people in the read, there will be very few people coming up with new ideas. Our country will stop making progress. Censorship in libraries is not only wrong, it goes against the key principles on which the was built. It makes the education level of the general population decrease, which in turn makes our country progress less quickly than other nations.

Althought books are good some have negative meanings in them and are not fit for young children. I have watched many movies and read many books, such as To a and I like both of these books and have watched the movie to both of them.

It has a very good background behind it, but it also has a srong grasp of how they treated in the twenty's. I have brought this up because certain ages of children should not be able to watch the movie or even read the book. First because most kids cannot comprehend the materials they are reading and second because the movie is graphic and has adult language. I know that certain people have different views and would not care if thier kids read or watch vulgar movies. I dont think it would be a good idea to completly get rid of all the books movies and magazines with more of an adult material in them because they would be boring.

5757,2,"I was asked for my opinion on whether or not certain books, music, etc., should be removed from libraries. I think libraries should be allowed to have an assortment of things. Some people think that censorship is a good thing because they feel kids are safer. Without censorship people can broden their minds and really feel what someone else is feeling. To prevent kids from reading certain books we could make a system. For each section of books we have a certain age group for those books. This way younger people can't accidently come across a bad book and older people can enjoy a classic book. I'm not much of a reader, but I know I'd be dissappointed if I went to the library and there wasn't a book. This is an example of a series of books that could be taken off the shelf. Pulling books off the shelf is a bad idea in my opinion. Books make you use your imagination and really concentrate on whats happening. I understand that there are strict parents who don't want their children reading fowl books. Not all books that have a few curse words are bad. They help you see how the character feels. I've read many books in my life, and I know that they all weren't appropriate for my age. If my parents had kept me from reading these books I not have the kind of knowledge I have today. Books can make you see, feel, touch, smell, and imagine. They are great to have no matter how good or bad they can get. I remember when the series came out. Not many parents let their kids read these books. If my parents hadn't let me then I wouldnt be interested in magical things. I dont see why any music should be kept out. The only music that is questionable is rap. It wont hurt anyone if we have headphones and don't sing aloud.I listen to music because, like books, it makes me think about how the artist was feeling when he sang a song.Or how a writer felt while coming up with lyrics. My favorite thing about music is that and listening to all the instruments playing. I could see myself in a library for hours just listening to some of my favorite music.

5758,2,"Do libraries need to remove books that do not have censorship? Many people have their own opinions to this question. People would say yes because they do not want children, their children especially, to be reading books that they think will have a bad influence on them. Certain material that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves of any library. '...if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work i adhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The meaning of this quote is that if we all had the power to remove any book that offended us, then there would be no more books in the library for anyone. Being offended is more of an opinion because not everybody is offended by the same things. A word could offend one person but not even bother the next. So if there is a certain word in a book and it offensive it should not be removed jus because of one or a couple people thinks its offensive. People have to relize that the world is evolving wheather that book is on the shelf or not their children are being exposed to explict everyday. If the book was to removed its is not going to change what they see walking down the street or on the television or game systems. Their children just have to have the maturity level to be capable to read material that has explict stuff. We had to read diffrent books for english class that had some material in it that some people would have found offensive. They have to be mature about whatever they are reading. Being 'offended' is jus two things opinions and maturity level of the reader. If a book effects them then they should not read it.

5759,2,"Censorship is a very conflicting topic. Debates over censorship in media have many have been present since around the In my opinion, to an extent media needs to be censored. But for the most part, whoever created the media, put great thought into their work and put every part in for for a reason. Censorship is conflicting, but can take away important qualities in the piece of work. Opinions vary, especially when it comes to cencorship. Lately, there has been arguments over the book, 'To A The book can be harsh, using foul language, violence, and talks about the characters being in bad situations. The most controversial part of this book is the use of the word 'nigger'. Some people took great offense to the use of this word in the book. In my opinion, by taking that out of the book takes away emphasis from the story. The book didn't use the word in an offensive way to the audience. It was used to depict the inhumane conditions the had to endure. The book does an incredible job of showing the reader what the people had to go through during that time; a time where the word 'nigger' was unfortunately used frequently. In order to tell the story in full detail and historically correct, the word was essencial. It played a significant role in the book. Cencorship is debatable, but I believe it isn't neccesary in most cases where it's taking away from the story. Censorship is a huge deal to the public. It is in children's movies moreseo than any other entertainment. Another example to show the debates are in the movie, '@NUM1 particular thing about the film that seemed problematic to some people was the fact that of the characters smoked. People believed that showing a character smoking persuaded children to start smoking. They strongly felt it would give their children the idea and the urge to want to smoke. I highly dissagree with their theory. The character that smoked was She was the antagonist in the movie. When watching the film, you get a bad vibe from the character and automatically know she's the doing the harm. Since children see her as the 'bad guy' or the 'villian', they are not going to want to start doing the things she is doing. The characters that do smoke in children's movies are always the antagonist, therefore, hinting smoking isn't a good thing. Children are exposed to smoking in many situations in real life. In restaurants, there are smoking sections. On the street, there's people smoking. Almost everywhere you go, children will be exposed to smoking. The antagonist in a children's film is not going to persuade them to pick up a bad habit, but this censorhip is very controversial. All in all, cencorship is a very common debate in our society. I believe that all media needs censorship to an extent, in order to keep it classy and give the entertainment good quality. I also believe that censoring too much of a good thing can absolutely ruin the work. Qualities in a piece of work are there for a specific reason. The author created it how it should be a majority of the time. I don't believe censorship should take away from the essence of a good piece of work and the message they're trying to get across.

Movies are found to be more offensive these days. There is tons of movies that have provanity and violence.

Do you know what kind of music your child is listening to? There is alot of offensive words in music. Listening to music and dancing is a great exercise but when you start to talk and act like the offensive music you listen to then parents aren't very happy.

5764,2,"Censorship.. Good or Is censorship a good or thing? Some people would agree that some books in the library are indeed offensive. Some people just so happen to like to read offensive books. Even though some books are offensive doesn't mean that they should be censored out of the library does it? Censorship in the library is a topic that some people think is a big discussion. Some people like that type of material. Now in some cases censorship is a good thing because some material be too offensive and needs to be censored out of the library. When i go into a library i don't see any books that i think are offensive, but personally i don't look for them. I have had people tell me that some books that they have read are offensive, but i havn't seen or read any. My views on this topic are a little bit of both. The only reason i would say censorship is a good thing is because i wouldn't want my son to go to a library and look at something he's not supposed to be looking at. I'm not trying to say censorship is good, because some people like to read, watch, and listen to that type of book, movie, and music. Out of my own experience i have seen offensive language in books, but that;s about it. In movies i have observed racist and sexist comments. Those two could be considered offensive to some people. In music it's the same thing. Those comments are offensive to people even though it's not directed at that person. Now it is true that song artist make a clean version of their song, but why say those offensive comments? Why not just make a clean version. This is where the people come in to action. Some people not see those comments as offensive, they just like the movie or the song, but to other people it hurt they feelings. As you can see they can be alot of different views on this subject.

5765,2,"Do you think that books that are offensive to people should be taken off the shelves of our libraries? Well I don't, I believe that all books should be left on shelves of our libraries even if they are offensive to someone. People have equal rights, ones who want to read the books should be able to take them off the shelves and ones that don't neccesarily like the context of the book can easily choose to not pick those books. Even if the book does offend someone else the other person should still be able to learn about it. One example would be if someone want to read a book on the disease of say has this condition, he might be offended by another person, reading about it. But what if wanted to work as a or even the person with disease, would have no clue about that. So if they had those books taken off the shelves there would be no way for who wants to be a to learn about this condition until he got a chance to work at a doctors place. He might even be lucky enough to learn about it in If take books off the shelves then some people wouldn't have any interest going into a because they might have only read those kinds of subjects for all anyone knows. I have found some books to be offensive to me, like ones about or with but I have delt with it. It doesn't matter if something offends you because if we took off every book that offends someone we wouldn't have any books left in the world. Somebody would eventually find something offensive in every book. Some people might find it offensive when an author writes a book on devil worshiping or some type of religion, but I myself a believer in would find something like that interesting not because I want to be like them, but because I think it is interesting to learn about other people's religions. I read about other types of religion, and the past wars in the books. I love learning about these types of things, but some other people find it offensive that they are talking about the war. The diaries are something special to the people who wrote them, they tell others about what they had to go through growing up and what hardships they still face today. Also if writers had their books taken off the shelves they would feel offended because people would be saying they didnt like that authors writing. We people can choose if we want to grab that book off of that shelf, nobody is telling us we have to pick that certain book. We have our own choices, there is nobody there to tell us to take the book.

I think what they should do is make a kid section like and adult section people I think that would be a good idea because then all the little kids and teenagers do not have to learn bad things in books or magazins or even through music i know it would be hard to do that because these days little kids are learning bad things through there parents or just by learning and look at other peolpe. If we can go to a librare that has those sections in ages it would be easer on kids because half of the time you learn new thingsin life through a book or mucis or even through a lkids and a life time magazins. Music these days are bad any more there is nothing but bad word's in a song and when you are trying to lissen to it with your kid around or the kids you babysitting for they would hear the bad word that the girl/guy just said in that song they would be askin and ? about what is that word and you have to tell them you would understand when you get older. thats why it is inmportent to seperat the seactions in a libraries so little kids dont have to hear those bad things ever were you go and I think its knda dumb to have bad words in a song sometimes because half of the time your kid is with you and there just learning bad words all the time so I think they should just keep that out of songs.

If i am wahtching a move with my nice/or nephew i have cover there eyes sometime because i do not want them to see how people do drugs or people have sex or people saying bad things now these days thats all there is sometimes to even make a move and it is just not right. Any more I have to watch kids moves with them because I do not want my nice and nephew to grow up and be like people in moves i want them to grow up and have a life and not be like othere people but there selfs thats why its also verey inmportent to put those moves in the adult area at the librarie.

I never hear from people that books can be bad for kids really books are books and sometimes when kids get a book they don't even read it all the way or they don't even read it at all they just sit there and look at it.

That means we can write down and publish anything you feel. The very materials that are used to publish things, books and other media, are directly what this part of the talks about. Also, with today's technology we have the internet, and libraries are already censoring that too. Now, I understand that libraries would block inappropriate things such as pornography, but not things like 'might-be-offensive' websites or religious articles. A final thing that the tells us is that we all have a freedom of religion. We have the right to practice or to not practice any religion we want. One shouldn't worry about what another religion says anyway right? If one is athiest, they should be offended about any religion, if anything they should take joy out of what 'foolishness' the other religions preach. Anything religious is just that, religious, and no one has the right here to take away someones faith, belivings and practices. If you ban certain books, music, movies and such you are hiding people from what other people might believe and taking away the people's free will and choices in life.

5769,2,"Dear newspaper, has been a big problem with parents not liking the books that are on the shelves. Some of the books that are on can be offensive to some people. Then again some people like to read those types of books. I think that people should have the say to remove the books, but the library should not always have to remove them. Even though is a major problem with offensive books I believe that the libraries should not take the books off the shelves. Other people want to read the book that some people think is offensive. They find that the book could be interesting ,and really enjoy that book. I can see where some parents are coming from when they say they do not want kid reading bad books. Some parents do not want kids to read about violence , so they would like the library to take it off the shelves. Then you could get a kid that really enjoys violent books, but since the library had to take the book off the shelve, now he is not able to read a book he is interested in. for parents should just tell kids what kinds of books they can get. Then the library does not have to go through and just start removing all of books. Then they can have more of a majority of books to choose from. If they go through and begin removing books that parents do not like they would have a small section of books for students to choose from. for all students can stay happy about library.

5770,2,"Libraries have some books, magazines, movies or music that not be suitable for younger children. I think those materials should be taken from the library. Most people come to the library to relax and enjoy books or a magazine or even get a movie. Some of these people though be children or others who are easily offended. If there was a really dirty book or magazine at the library it wouldn't be that hard for a child to get ahold of it. Then the child would be looking or reading something they really shouldn't be reading. Some other people be offended by a book that might have racial slurs in it and horrible scenes. Some movies or music from the library can be pretty bad and you wouldn't want any kid listening to it or some person being offended by the music. Some music can also send a wrong message to a young person like drugs and alcohol are alright for someone to do. If someone found out a library had horrible movies or music they might start to boycott that library which would then hurt that library. All this offensive material could steal away a childs innocence which shouldn't be taken away at such a young age. In the end these items could potentially hurt your local library.

5771,2,"I think the libraries should be censored. I would not let my children to be exposed to a harmful enviorment. Kids now a days idollizeing people that do, or say harmful things. The kids watch movies that curse, and are sometimessexist, or even raceist. I would not wont my children to grow up like the people like that. The library should be a safe enviorment for kids to learn. No library should even carry that kind of stuff, it is a kids friendly zone. Why in the world would any parent let their child read, or listen to that kind of things. The books and magazines that are offensive should be removed from the shelves. We do not wont little children be exposed to the harmful things in the books. The books that have curseing should be removed. Little kids now a days are beeing more, and more exposed to the curesing. The library should be a place where little children can be safe from the harmful thing in the books. Music is becoming a world wide favorite to children.

The singers in and other harsh music is trying to get little kids to listen to their music, and buy their They do that by making there songs cool by putting in bad words. The parent sure be the only person to allow their children to listen to that music. Movies should be remove from the shelves, because of the curseing and nude sceens. Little children should not be exposed to all of these things. No parents will and shounld not let their children to be exposed of those things at an early age. The childrens minds growing at that age, and they will pick up on that stuff. Kids are beening exposed so much these days, wheather it is at school, or from friends. Parents can not stop that from happening in school, but they can control what they read, and what they watch and listen to. I think censorship in libraries is a wonderful idea. It is a good way from keeping the children from beeing exposed of the valger things the world has to ofter.

5772,2,"I think that no matter what the material is, it should not be censored. Even if it is the most gruesome, sexual book, there will always be at least one person gaining from reading that book. As long as there is one person gaining from it, there is absolutely no reason to remove it from any library. If we removed everything offensive from libraries, there would be nothing left, as the quote points out. There will always be someone offended by it, due to religion, personal preferences or experiences. Even if a book is offensive, just downright instigating a riot, it can be learned from if looked at in the right manner. Offensive material can also get children ready for the real world. If adults keep everything slightly violent or sexual out of books, children won't know what to do when they see it in the real world. If children aren't taught about the repercussions of things, then whats to stop them from being curious and doing it themselves? Many people would say that offensive material corrupts their children, giving them bad thoughts and provoking them to do things they don't approve of. I think that the media shouldn't be blamed for this. A child wouldn't murder someone after seeing it on unless there was something already in their head, which is where it's the parents job, not the There is definitely some questionable material floating in the media, but they would only negatively affect the public if they viewed it as such. There shouldn't be a problem as long as people view it as just a source of entertainment. Why should the people who can't make that connection get the books removed and taken away from the general public? If they didn't get anything from that book, why does that give them the say that no one else ever will? In an article, there was research proving that children that read books with sexual themes were less likely to commit rape. This is a very good reason why things like that shouldn't be removed. Exposing them to the sexual themes, and showing when and where its right or wrong. Again, it is helping people in some form, which should never be taken away. Overall, the reasons in favor of banning are very outweighed by the reasons in favor of keeping the books.

5774,2,"Offensive I strongly believe offensive books, music, and magazines, or things that people just simply read, should be taken out. A lot of people, including myself, don't want to hear those kind of things. Those are the things that should be kept to oneself. Books, music, and magazines should be something that people enjoy looking at instead of having offensive and not nice things in them. Yes, I understand that some authors have offensive things in their books because it goes along with the book, but it can be in a better state of form instead of hateful. Kids shouldn't get a book that has offensive things in them, because if I were a parent, I wouldn't want my kids reading them. Some authors realize it but most of them don't understand what they are putting in books. There's way more interesting things to write about than offensive things. In music, some songs are horrible, especially in rap. Most of the artists sing about aren't for everyone to hear. Artists simply just seem like they are trying to imply people to drink, do drugs, and hurt other people because of the words in songs in songs. The music now days has changed majorly. I have noticed that people are doing more then what's in the songs than what's in their heart, so artists need to take the non qualified words out and have the songs happy and jittery. I know of many people that change the radio station because of bad words or bad things in songs because they just don't want to listen to it. A magazine is one of the biggest offensive item a person can read. I understand that people want to hear about the famous people, but a lot of times, artists just put down the other stars. Magazines were made to enjoy and learn instead of hearing all the downer attitude things. If the famous people are doing a horrible thing why put it in the magazine, because a lot of the stars are good role models and if they do something wrong, most likely others will too. I don't like hearing offensive things about other people, so that's why I think that offensive things should be removed from the shelves. If are removed from the shelves, then the artists and authors will hopefully realize that we don't want to hear it and maybe they will change it.

5775,2,"There are many subjects that come to mind when I consider the idea of inappropriate subjects certain people should not see when it comes to the public. The thought of little kids picking up a magazine meant for a mature audience, just doesn't sound right. I'm sure every parent wants to do their best to shelter their child away from such ideas. But should such material be censored from everyone in libraries? Amercia has been blessed with the right of freedom to a certain extant. People have the ability to read what it is they desire to read. Who's to say we can't, right? If one person is given the power to take a book off the shelfs that they feel is offensive to a certain audience then that would give someone else just the same amount of right to do the same to material they don't want out in the public. Eventually, the variety of books or magazines in certain subjects would be very limited. This idea being because everyone has different views on what is or isn't appropriate for libraries to hold on their shelfs. One person's view is their personal thought, and that doesn't mean that they're thought is morally correct to someone else. Not everyone is going to be willing to abide by someone else's views. Parents will tend to lean on the side of censorship. Typically, parents want to keep their children and every other child away from mature material. Libraries are made for the public though, not just children alone. If you wish to take your child to the library, can he or she not just stay in their appropriate section? If a parent fears their child laying their eyes on such volger or offensive material, then guide your child to their correct mind set to disregard looking at things going against those matters. Raise your child to understand certain subjects should not be part of their knowledge. Libraries being public allow an older audience to pursue looking at what they desire. Mature people shouldn't be restricted on guidelines meant for immature people. We have the right to read, listen, or look at what it is we want. A public library holds the oppertunity that some do not have to search for what we are interested in. This subject is hard to discuss because everyone has their different ideas on it. Just as everyone having their different ideas on what should and shouldn't be censored. Every's mind is different, and no one can control any one mind. People should have the freedom to walk into a library and obtain what they want. If you were to pick up a book concerning a religion you don't believe in, you can simply just not take part in reading it. Same as if you pick up a product you feel is morally incorrect and inappropriate, I don't believe it's that hard to not look at it. With proper judgement for what you think is right or wrong for you, you can make your own decision on what you read or listen to.

5776,2,"Protection. Limits. Necessity. These are some of the excuses used when a person is defending censorship. '@CAPS1's for the greater good' or '@CAPS1's really a necessity to protect the young minds'. Reasoning like this is exactly what sounds like-- nonsense excuses. Who can define what is too much for children or teenagers to read? And what exactly does 'too much' mean anyways? Too much violence? Too much information? Too much of what? Censorship sounds good in theory, but should absolutely not be allowed. Nobody wants their sweet child to come across something that will upset them or blemish their young, pure minds. But the fact of the matter is that the world is not perfect. There is violence, and murder, and drugs, and death, and all sorts of things we would rather not ever happen, that occurs every day. But simply not reading about the tragedies does not change the fact that they happen. Censorship 'protect' the minds of people while they are young, but one day these young children will grow up. They will live in the real world, an uncensored edition, and they need to be prepared. A couple of years ago, we were learning about censorship that happens in We read the novel was horrible reading about the horrors and tragedies that occurred during reign. But the worst part was reading how they worshipped the man who was ruining their lives. He took away their teachers, their jobs, their homes, and their lives--and they thanked him. They believed he was doing everything to help them. These people were not stupid, but they were unaware. Their lives were censored. did not occur to them that their precious was leading them astray because they had never been exposed to the bad things about him. This is the reality of censorship. Finally, censorship is a bad idea because is immoral. Censorship is a defining factor of control. If a person can take away the knowledge that is available to you, they can control what you learn. They can control what you believe. If we allow our libraries in schools to be censored, then how can people complain when the governments censor information? People say 'I'm a citizen of this land and I have a right to know!' But if the citizens have a right to information, so should the children. Parents help their children in many ways, but censorship should not be considered 'helping' them. Ultimately, censorship happens. A few weeks ago, terrorist was finally killed. Images of his dead body have not been released though, to 'protect the public'. People can have whatever views they want on his death, but because their has been no proof, many people still believe was a conspiracy. Censorship aim to help people, but all does is hurt them. They have to choose what to believe without knowing all the facts. Censorship should be kept out of our libraries.",8574,8575.0,Protection  Limits  Necessity  These excuses used person defending censorship    CAPS s greater good    CAPS s really necessity protect young minds   Reasoning like exactly sounds like  nonsense excuses  Who define much children teenagers read  And exactly too much  mean anyways  Too much violence  Too much information  Too much  Censorship sounds good theory  absolutely allowed  Nobody wants sweet child come across something upset blemish young  pure minds  But fact matter world perfect  There violence  murder  drugs  death  sorts things would rather ever happen  occurs every day  But simply reading tragedies change fact happen  Censorship protect  minds people young  one day young children grow  They live real world  uncensored edition  need prepared  A couple years ago  learning censorship happens We read novel horrible reading horrors tragedies occurred reign  But worst part reading worshipped man ruining lives  He took away teachers  jobs  homes  lives  thanked  They believed everything help  These people stupid  unaware  Their lives censored  occur precious leading astray never exposed bad things  This reality censorship  Finally  censorship bad idea immoral  Censorship defining factor control  If person take away knowledge available  control learn  They control believe  If allow libraries schools censored  people complain governments censor information  People say  I m citizen land I right know   But citizens right information  children  Parents help children many ways  censorship considered helping   Ultimately  censorship happens  A weeks ago  terrorist finally killed  Images dead body released though  protect public   People whatever views want death  proof  many people still believe conspiracy  Censorship aim help people  hurt  They choose believe without knowing facts  Censorship kept libraries 
5777,2,"Censorship in libraries is a somewhat controversial issue. Parents of young children any books, movies, music, magazines and other things to be banned from the shelves of libraries that have even the slightest hint of offensive content. On the other hand parents of older children find that the child, depending on the age, should be able to judge whether the content of the book, movie or magazine they are reading is appropriate or not. Soon the issue becomes a battle of whether the child is mature enough to handle certain content, and if so content? Censorship is important when the material is extremely offensive, but there must be an accurate judgement of whether the material is appropriate for certain children or not. People who are for the censorship of any and all offensive or innapropriate material in libraries, are generally parents of young or immature children. Those parents worry that if their child gets their hands on certain materials that they will start to behave like the descriptions within the book, movie, magazine, etc. They also worry that a relatively mature teenager will evolve into a rebellious child, from the intake of innapropriate/offensive library materials. Some parents who support the censorship anything that has even the slightest hint of mature content off of the library shelves. These parents are forgetting that many times, is not allowed becomes all the child wants. Children who are deprived of certain things, can become addicts for that specific item. adults try so hard to hide seems mysterious and cool to teenagers and suddenly, they are preocupied with trying to gain access to that one thing. '@CAPS1 I can't have, I Children should be protected from high intakes of certain violent themes and mature content, but there needs to be someone to define 'mature' and 'offensive' are. There are also people who believe that since the library is a public place, children should be able to go there and read they it should be the child's decision. This is often seen with parents of older children. They believe that their child is mature enough to judge the material that they hold in their hand. Some teens are capable of making good judgments on things that they watch and read, but others are not. Some will spiral out of control if there are no boundaries set for they can and cannot do. A teenager should be able to make a good judgement on whether or not they should read a certain book or watch a certain movie, but that doesn't always happen. There really needs to be a third party who can help guide young children and teenagers to books and other things appropriate for their age group. Having a person to decide whether the content is appropriate for a fifteen year old is a better choice than the parent saying 'no' or the library hiding it. Having someone there to help set boundaries is also better than just letting the teen go off into the world without a shred of guidence. Though not always the case, children and teenagers be mature enough to handle certain content and be able to judge for themselves if the content is appropriate or not. Teenagers can be so distracted by all the hormones, family life, and school that they are blinded and unable to make good decisions. Censorship is necesary and important but needs to be put to use in a reasonable way. I do not believe that a parent who sees one scene in a movie that involves hugging or a minor romantic situation that the movie should be banned.

5778,2,"Have you ever read a book that you just absolutely love? Now this book might just happen to contain some vulgar parts or language that is out of the norm, but is just the greatest book. A few weeks later you tell your friend that she has to read this book too. You both run down to the library to check out, only to find that the book has been removed from the shelves. Many libraries nowadays have become very strict on what they allow students to read or hear. I am hear to persuade you that all students, and people in general, should have the right to read whatever is that they want and not be deprived from because of others opnions. To begin, one main reason that certain materials would be removed from a library would be for vulgar ideas in the context. Many students will take a book, or magazine, or movie home from a library and parents get very angry. They feel their does not need to be seeing that kind of material. So, they immediately call the library at which was borrowed and demand that be taken off the shelves. In this case, many libraries will see to this request, and will remove the material from the public. Only one problem, just because one person does not want to watch does not mean that others do not want to see either. For example, back when I was in middle school there was a book entitled, 'A that all my friends had been reading. I was interested in reading this book, so I went to my library and checked out. That book taught me many lessons that I am not sure an adult could. opened my eyes to see the very harmful things that abuse can cause for a Later on that same week I told my friend that she had to read so we went down to the library only to find had been removed from the school. Although the book contained some, at times, intense and saddening content, was an incredible story that taught me many lessons that to this day I will not forget. And now is removed forever. I feel that that is not fair to other students at all. We should have the right to read what we so choose. Second, things seen as offensive to some not be seen as offensive to others. I personally do not like scary, ghorry, bloody type movies. That is my opnion and I do not have to watch them. On the otherhand, scary movies could be a favorite to some people. Now, is fair for me to say that because those scary movies offend me, other people should not be allowed to watch them either? No. Just because offends my personal beliefs does not mean should be off limits to everyone else. One main cause of offense would be religion. Some people, in a library, might find an article or paper that undermines their religion. Of course they will take offense to this, but that does not mean should be removed from the shelf. Everyone has their own opnion, and some find things to be more offensive than others. If you don't care for the topic or content of the article, then don't read I hope to have persuaded you into believing why everyone is entitled to reading, or listening, or viewing any material they choose. We all have rights to do so. Please write to your local libraries voicing your personal opinion on the topic. Hopefully in the future, we will be allowed to enjoy the material we want, instead of what is considered to be 'okay'.",8578,8579.0,Have ever read book absolutely love  Now book might happen contain vulgar parts language norm  greatest book  A weeks later tell friend read book  You run library check  find book removed shelves  Many libraries nowadays become strict allow students read hear  I hear persuade students  people general  right read whatever want deprived others opnions  To begin  one main reason certain materials would removed library would vulgar ideas context  Many students take book  magazine  movie home library parents get angry  They feel need seeing kind material  So  immediately call library borrowed demand taken shelves  In case  many libraries see request  remove material public  Only one problem  one person want watch mean others want see either  For example  back I middle school book entitled   A friends reading  I interested reading book  I went library checked  That book taught many lessons I sure adult could  opened eyes see harmful things abuse cause Later week I told friend read went library find removed school  Although book contained  times  intense saddening content  incredible story taught many lessons day I forget  And removed forever  I feel fair students  We right read choose  Second  things seen offensive seen offensive others  I personally like scary  ghorry  bloody type movies  That opnion I watch  On otherhand  scary movies could favorite people  Now  fair say scary movies offend  people allowed watch either  No  Just offends personal beliefs mean limits everyone else  One main cause offense would religion  Some people  library  might find article paper undermines religion  Of course take offense  mean removed shelf  Everyone opnion  find things offensive others  If nt care topic content article  nt read I hope persuaded believing everyone entitled reading  listening  viewing material choose  We rights  Please write local libraries voicing personal opinion topic  Hopefully future  allowed enjoy material want  instead considered okay

5780,2,"When you take material off a library shelf, are you taking away an opportunity to learn? Censorship in libraries is a controvercial subject. Should offensive material be taken off shelves so people don't have the opportunity to be offended? No material should be taken off library shelves because taking something off its shelf takes away an opportunity to learn something new, discover a new apreciation, form an opinion, and come to better understand the world that we are living in. Library censorship is a controvercial subject mainly because what different people find 'offensive' varies. Morals, ehtics, race, gender and anything else that impacts how you think can determine what you believe should be censored in a library, or anywhere else for that matter. What you think should be censored, however, is probably not exactly what others around you think. You think that a certain type of music should not be placed on the library shelves, while others think that your favorite song is wildly innapropriate and offensive. If you take the music off the shelf that you think is unreasonable then that gives others grounds to take off things that you enjoy very much as well as anything else then please. goes for anything in a library: books magazines, movies, and more. Who is to say what you should have the priviledge of knowing and what you shouldn't? If library censorship is taken to the extreme, who is to say what should be kept and what should be thrown out with the garbage? These are questions that, in themeselves, would cause controvercy! Library censorship would be replacing one offensive act with another. issue, perhaps would be even harder to deal with. If one person has the right to take something off the library shelf than anyone has the right to take something they feel is unneeded off the shelf as well. If continued, there would be nothing left to read, watch, or learn from. There is not a single piece of material in a library that is not controvercial or does not offend anyone or any group. Though, everything is controvercial in some aspect, that does not mean that anything should be thrown out, never to be read or viewed again. would take away an opportunity to learn; to understand! Just as everything is controvercial or offensive to someone, also every piece of material in a library has information that is valuable! If something isn't valuable it would not be published. If no one enjoyed a piece of material than it wouldn't have been written in the first place. Even if something has seemingly no value to you, it might be the very thing that someone else treasures more than anything else. A piece of material has value when someone can glean information from it, when someone can form an oppinion about something, when someone can compare and contrast views, or when you can better understand the world around you because of it. When you take material off a library shelf, are you taking away an oportunity to learn? Yes! Every book, movie, magazine, or song is offensive to someone because everyone has a different view of what offensive is to them and to the people around them. If one thing is taken off a library shelf, everything must be taken off their shelves! Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' truly puts my point into perspective. Every piece of material in a library is valuable to someone (otherwise it wouldn't be there). Also, I can say from personal experience, anything can become valuable to someone if they are given the oportunity to read it, view it, or listen to it. No material should be taken off library shelves because taking something off its shelf takes away an opportunity to learn something new, discover a new apreciation, form an opinion, and come to better understand the world they are living in",8582,8583.0,When take material library shelf  taking away opportunity learn  Censorship libraries controvercial subject  Should offensive material taken shelves people nt opportunity offended  No material taken library shelves taking something shelf takes away opportunity learn something new  discover new apreciation  form opinion  come better understand world living  Library censorship controvercial subject mainly different people find offensive  varies  Morals  ehtics  race  gender anything else impacts think determine believe censored library  anywhere else matter  What think censored  however  probably exactly others around think  You think certain type music placed library shelves  others think favorite song wildly innapropriate offensive  If take music shelf think unreasonable gives others grounds take things enjoy much well anything else please  goes anything library  books magazines  movies   Who say priviledge knowing nt  If library censorship taken extreme  say kept thrown garbage  These questions  themeselves  would cause controvercy  Library censorship would replacing one offensive act another  issue  perhaps would even harder deal  If one person right take something library shelf anyone right take something feel unneeded shelf well  If continued  would nothing left read  watch  learn  There single piece material library controvercial offend anyone group  Though  everything controvercial aspect  mean anything thrown  never read viewed  would take away opportunity learn  understand  Just everything controvercial offensive someone  also every piece material library information valuable  If something nt valuable would published  If one enjoyed piece material would nt written first place  Even something seemingly value  might thing someone else treasures anything else  A piece material value someone glean information  someone form oppinion something  someone compare contrast views  better understand world around  When take material library shelf  taking away oportunity learn  Yes  Every book  movie  magazine  song offensive someone everyone different view offensive people around  If one thing taken library shelf  everything must taken shelves  Author Katherine Paterson said  All us think book hope none children children taken shelf  But I right remove book shelf  work I abhor  also exactly right everyone else  And books left shelf us   truly puts point perspective  Every piece material library valuable someone  otherwise would nt   Also  I say personal experience  anything become valuable someone given oportunity read  view  listen  No material taken library shelves taking something shelf takes away opportunity learn something new  discover new apreciation  form opinion  come better understand world living
5781,2,"Censorship in libraries is a very bad way to go about solving a problem that affects everyone. It is very difficult to write something that does not offend someone in any way, shape, or form. If someone has a problem with a writing then do not read it. If every writing that ever offended someone was pulled from the shelves of a library, then there would be few writings left to read. In order to write a writing that does not offend anyone, you would need to write it for little kids that are just leasrning to read, because most of those topics are innocent and avoid tricky situations. Almost any writing of considerable size has something in it that could 'offend' a person, like witchcraft or wars. Writings that have stereotypes are easily offensive to many types of and most books have at least one stereotype to describe a character in that story, like 'big and dumb.' need to get over being upset with writings they do not like and just not read them, because someone else might want to. Everything was written for a specific group of If you are not in that group, then fine, just do not take that writing or music away from someone who is. need to figure out that they should not go and turn the world into solely their idea of what the world should be, and the same should be said for writings and music.

5782,2,"There are a lot of books out on shelves that shouldn't be on them. Should, those kinds of books be taken off the shelves or put into a section that only adults can go into? I believe that there are enough books out there for young kids and young adults to read. If, we as people get these books off the shelves, then a lot of people will be upset. The right thing to do is keep them out of reach of kids and young adults just till they get to the right age to understand that kind of stuff. Taking these kinds of books off the shelves would change the way books are made. If books are getting to the point where we can't even put them on the shelves for anyone to see, then they should be in a different section so the people that are into that kind of stuff can still enjoy reading. By taking books off the shelves will only lead to conflict later on. If parents don't want there kid reading that kind of stuff, then the parents need to be responsible to keep them away. That's why when you go to the library or book store, they have different section's so you know what your getting yourself into.

5783,2,"Banned or What comes to mind when you see a book or song that is offensive or uncensored? Do you leave it alone or do you choose to report it? In the past there has been an absolute abundance of racism, segregation, and gender opppositions. These foul acts are leading to offensive and stereotypical problems. Now a days you can walk into any ordinary library and witness books of racism yourself or hear music that makes a race of people inferior to others. The truth is; these people are writing music and books based on what they believe and what they have been persuaded to believe. My thoughts on the topic of censorship are quite simple and straight to the point. I believe that if I see or hear something in a library that seems offensive to me then it should be put out and banned from any other library. I mean I am pretty sure that anyone would think the same way if they saw something in a library that made fun of their race or a person in specific race. I understand that authors and singers spend a bunch of time planning out their songs and books, but I have been taught to always think before I do something. I am sure that when an authors and singers are producing their work that they are thinking of the consequences towards their actions, but obviously if censorship is occurring then these people are not thinking clearly. Most artist produce songs not thinking in the consequences, but their followers still enjoy the music. Also, there are a lot of authors that write books that concern other races that don't believe what they say is true. I am not saying that they should just get rid of all offensive material in the libraries, but just that they get rid of those few that have crossed the bounderies. Another important factor in censorship is that without censorship what would happen to the children that pick up these books. Would you like to see your child pick up a book that shows racist pictures or words and see the look on his face as his smile slowly turns into a frown? Or how about watching your son listening to a song by accident that speaks about how only one race is superior and that drugs are what life is to live for? I would never desire that for my children and I can just hope that you agree as well. In conclusion, I believe that censorship is a great idea, but that it shouldn't be such a serious concern at the moment. If libraries are going to release offensive material out for the public to experience then they should keep it in an adult section and away from young pupils. Let censorship live on and pray for it to continue eliminating offensive material.",8588,8589.0,Banned What comes mind see book song offensive uncensored  Do leave alone choose report  In past absolute abundance racism  segregation  gender opppositions  These foul acts leading offensive stereotypical problems  Now days walk ordinary library witness books racism hear music makes race people inferior others  The truth  people writing music books based believe persuaded believe  My thoughts topic censorship quite simple straight point  I believe I see hear something library seems offensive put banned library  I mean I pretty sure anyone would think way saw something library made fun race person specific race  I understand authors singers spend bunch time planning songs books  I taught always think I something  I sure authors singers producing work thinking consequences towards actions  obviously censorship occurring people thinking clearly  Most artist produce songs thinking consequences  followers still enjoy music  Also  lot authors write books concern races nt believe say true  I saying get rid offensive material libraries  get rid crossed bounderies  Another important factor censorship without censorship would happen children pick books  Would like see child pick book shows racist pictures words see look face smile slowly turns frown  Or watching son listening song accident speaks one race superior drugs life live  I would never desire children I hope agree well  In conclusion  I believe censorship great idea  nt serious concern moment  If libraries going release offensive material public experience keep adult section away young pupils  Let censorship live pray continue eliminating offensive material 
5784,2,"Have you ever thought that some books, music, movies, and magazines should not be in the library? I believe very strongly on this matter. There are three main points as to why there shouldn't be certain material introduced to people in the library. The three main points are that some books are filled with unuseful information and they just take up space, children can access unappropriate sites from the library, and also children can view adult content books, movies, and magazines. One point that was stated is that some books do not need to be in the library. This is because it contain some pointless information that hardly anyone would ever use. This takes up plenty of space. It also takes away from people who check out informative books because the useless books that have no information take the place of books that help readers out with what ever the subject be. Another factor of a library, is that children can have easy access to unapropriate web sites. Some examples can be pornagraphy, violent news, and many other garbage that can be found on the internet. These can teach children plenty of bad habits. Also, they could learn some things that they are too immature to understand or deal with. This can cause a problem in society. For example, in my generation, teens at the early age of fifteen are sexually active and many do drugs even before the age of fifteen. This is ridiculous! When I have children, I am going to make sure I can do what ever I need to do in order to protect them from this behavior. Parents now do not realize what is going on or they are being lazy parents. Lazy parents are the ones that do not care what their children do. This is really sad. The last, but most important point I want to discuss is that children can also have access to adult content books, movies, and magazines. This can also have an effect on children because they can be learning about things that are way over their heads. I believe that the library should set age limits as to who exits and enters the library. If a child needs a book or something, I believe an adult should get it for them because they could roam around the library and pick up some inappropriate material. Children learning about this kind of material can lead to pregnant teens, addiction to drugs, and many social problems. Even though many people do not realize it, libraries can be very dangerous to children. Children can easily have access to adult content books, movies, magazines, web sites. Also, there are many books in the library that are filled with useless information that are taking up the space need for informative books. I believe libraries should make sure that children are safe when it comes to viewing inapproprate material. Libraries should also only contain important informative books that people need for research.

5785,2,"No I do not think that libraries should have to take out all books, music, movies, and so on what other people would find offensive. I think that is would be deeply unfair to some people who find nothing wrong with such material to have it be taken away from them for no reason except for the fact of some people's opions. Some books contain information about past wars yet they have some graphic pictures that young kids should not be looking at but whose problem is that ? Certianly not the libraries, because the libraries are a place that is meant for learning not to be on a limited restriction since some kids don't know how to keep there hands off things that they should not be looking at. Since when is it fair to be taking romance novels with graphics away from people who just want to enjoy a little imagination because maybe thats the only romance and love they could get. Or what about medical students looking up medical treatments they need some books that show alot of blood, to help them learn for school. Also some people listen to offensive music, so what, maybe thats the kind of music they like or what if thats the only way for them to release stress. I mean haven't you had a stressful day before where you just want to listen to some music about offensive things to ease the pain. There are also many movies that have much offensive in it, if you want a movie that has no offensive parts in it good luck with that one, you might want to go back to the or even later. Basically every movie have some type of offensive to it when you could least expect it. Magazines are probably the worst when it comes to offensive things, but sometimes people can't help what they have to do to earn a buck in this world. Yes, you shall probably see many naked women or women in skimpy outfits but its their job and maybe the only one they could get. They probably have familes to and just want to support them, what would you do for you family ? I do agree that magazines are probably not the best for libraries but sometimes they have new and information on the latest things. People dont have to look at these magazines tho, its their choice. So how many of you people would enjoy not being able to sit in a quite library and enjoy a nice magazine because maybe one person finds it offensive. What my point is through all of this is that no matter how hard you want to try and take out all the inapporiate material from libraries theres always gonna be something somewhere that you would least expect it.

5786,2,"Censorship is a very thought up topic that many people argue and debate. A vast wide range of different media is offered in librarys, such as books, movies, magazines, and sometimes music. Librarys offer these types of media to all who come into a library. Librarys have censorship on some of the media; but not all is censored. Picking up a piece of media that is not apporiate or has explicit material in it is the persons choice that will be purchashing that material. Censorship should be enforced a little bit in librarys; but some take it to far. The freedom of speech is what this country is based on, freedom to say or read anything that one persons mind express. Materials that a person writes is from that ones mind, they have a right to express their views or storys. It takes time to create a piece of media, let it be on the shelf of the library due to the fact that it was a piece of work. Censorship should rarely be seen, unless that is talking about pornography that should be censored to a certain age limit. Books that have explicit content shouldnt be banned off of a shelf it should just simply be rated to an age limit. Every one does not read the same material as the person who wants media of a certain type banned. People like action, horror, romance , adventure and mystery, some of those genres will have explicit material. That doesnt mean that it should be banned because on person does not like it. Leave it alone if it does not fit the taste of a good book or movie. Other people might think it is a great piece of art, so it should not be banned.

5787,2,"Have your ever looked for a book in the libray, but you end up not finding it? Some libraries censor books or they dont have them, because its unopropiate. Libraries do that because they dont want kids under age to be looking at stuff that they should not be looking. I think that libraries shouldnt do that, because theres people out their that want to know about stuff they dont know and the libraires censor them. Thats one mistake that the libray does, thats what i think. Other people have different opinions than mine. I dont support censor from any books. People that write books want to express everything they feel or they can imagine, but sometimes they cant. The reason they cant are because the censorships in libraries. The people in the world have a different oppinon then what i think. Some support because they think that its agaisnt religion or other beliefs that people be showing their expressions like that, and that the library wont censor it. Just like Katherine Paterson said ' we have the right to touch or pull any book from the libraries'. I think shes right but minors have to respect that they should not touch books that they are not allowed to touch. If the book you got or pulled is offensive to you then my opinion is not to read it, because you would not like it. For example pornograhic books or magazines they are not allowed in the libraries because of sexual talk or pictures.

5788,2,"Nobody likes to have rumors or anything that could change peoples outlook on them opened to the whole world. If there is material that is offensive to others being published and the person that is being talked badly about doesn't want it published, he/she should have a say in it. There have been many ways to get peoples buisness out there; books, television, magazines, movies and even on the radio. I believe personal buisness is just that, something kept personal and away from people that have no right of knowing. The internet is one of the prime sources of information, good or bad. People upload pictures and information daily knowing the risk. This is an option that was a self made choice, instead of personal information getting published unknowingly. Nobody should be publishing anything about someone else without their persmision. Things like this should be able to be taken down or destroyed all records of if the victim would like. Nobody should have to go through something they did not participate in causing. Lately in society it feels like people feed off of other peoples misery. I felt this pain before as a child, and since I am in highschool the rumors just grow and grow each year. About of the world if not all have been judged falsely or accused of something one did not do, but over the years the pain seemed to fade away with peoples memory. Although memories fade, books are forever. Nobody should have to be remembered as something there not, did or did not do or said or did not say. If you walk into a book store today some of the first books you see are books about peoples lives, their careers or what the have commited to society. Theres also books known as magazines that are the other half of books, the darker half. These 'books' let people know what is happening in society good or bad. In the magazine world its the magazine that interest the people more that are the ones that sell more, and the thing poeple like most in the world today are rumors. Now magazines kind of work like books do in a sort of way. If books are forever so are magazines. Once somebodies information gets in a magazine its now out there for the world to see, and nobody likes bad or false information getting told about them. Nobody would like to be remembered as someone there not. I believe that nobody should have to go through something they did not particpate in causing. Nobody should have to be remembered as something there not, did or did not do or said or did not say. Nobody would like to be remembered as someone there not. Nobody likes to be the bad guy in everyones eyes. I believe that you should be judged in life according to your own actions, not those of other people. If people are writing or saying offensive things about people, the person being talked about have the choice if they want the whole world to see it or not, do not make it the worlds choice.

5789,2,"All people have there own taste in what kind of books , music , movies , magazines , ect .What I think about censorship in libraries is it shoulden't be aloud.Because all people like different thing's and they might not have what they like and came there to look for. Someone could be doing a report on anything and go to the library and try and find magazines and such to support there work and they might not have nothing on what there looking for.Libraries could loose peoples service that come in there. An experience like this with me would be when I was doing a project over drug abuse and I needed information for it because the internet didn't have all I needed. So I had to go to the library and I foun't more books on it . But if drug abuse is offensive to someone and they take books like that out of the library I woulden't have foun't anything on it to help me.But it was kind of different with me they had what I needed. If someone don't like what they see then they don't have to pay any attention to it , just keep on looking. Just because a couple of people don't like what they are seeing don't mean the next person don't.Also just because its offensive to someone doesn't mean it is to everyone.I kind of understand where some people come from about their kids seeing that kind of stuff but if you don't want your kid around it then they should stay where the little kid books are. Such as music if your listening to it at the library you should be using head phones anyways , so noone else is going to hear the music you like or if someone else thinks it's offensive. So they should really not be taking any kind of music out people like there own music and if their listening to it , im sure it should be to themselves. Then there's apart of me saying kids don't know what they are picking up and if their parents are looking at something and not paying attention to them then there going to be looking at something their parent dont want them looking at.So thats a bad things about offensive things beeing in the library because its for everyone.But for the most part your kids shoulden't be looking at stuff they aint suppose to in the first place.

5790,2,"I believe that if we take books off of the shelves that people find offensive then there would be no books on the shelves. Every book has something offensive in it, wether the reader knows it or not. Magazines, are a great source of offensive material. They are out there with there own opionon whether you like it or not. I've read plenty of books and magazines that had offensive things in them. If people are going to start critisizing movies then might as well take them off the dvd racks or stop production all together. Everybody has an opionon about certain things. For example the book they have an offense to us or as they call muggles. I don't believe that they are going to take a best seller out the bookstores or anywhere because of that. Or the also, their gansters or outcasts, however you want to put them as, and there are plenty of offenses in that book but its very well written and all around good book. What I think when I hear the word censored i think of and how they block out a womans chest or a males penis, a book is all about imagery if you want to see those things don't censor them out. I have learned alot from a show I watch constantly, Its a great show but yes it does a lot of things that need to be censored, do I complain to the production agency because of it? No i do not. Also she's very smart and she doesnt place alot on physcology, and calls it a soft science. I believe differently, but i don't find it offensive because she doesn't like it. I guess it depends on the kind of person you are, if you want a certain thing censored then no one can change your opionon. There are tons of things in life that need censored even the natural world around us. Or a biology book because there are things in there that arent all that good either.

5791,2,"People throughout society today are exposed to censorship due to movies, music, books, and other similiar materials. Today's young people know more about censory than many of us knew about in the earlier years. Parents educate their children on contraceptives and illegal habits and other situations that will appear throughout the human society. But, not all of the parents take the time to do that for their children, that doesn't mean the child doesn't get educated. Schools and other corporations take the time to teach young adults about situations that will eventually come up in life. If you think about it, people are not the only place to find out about censorship though. Public libraries contain books, movies, music, and internet access where an individual can obtain many facts about certain ideas, topics, or even just personal questions. But, should this be a place where we can go and find out about certain things without parental permission. is a period of time where we all go through the phase where we question things and become curious about things that be happening around us or just throughout the world. Children go through the phase where they should know about personal intercourse between opposite sex, or the dangerous medications or the illegal substances that can cause major danger. Lets perhaps think, should each and everyone of us have free resources that allow young adults and even children explore on such topics. Different families and individuals people have their own outlooks on specific things. Religion take huge part in someone's life, which restrict them from certian circumstances. Today's world has changed enormeously from twenty years ago. The resources were not as available to all of us as they are today. In my perspective i believe that we should be exposed to the censorship but are times when a limit should be set. Public libraries give the public the chance to research and read, and watch about an umlimited amount of resources. is a certain circumstance where finding things out should not be as easy as it is. Although, the facts that are out are not always the complete truth, which lead certain individuals in the wrong thinking about a certain situation. The internet and technology has brought us so far, many of us rely on this resource. Not always does this lead us to the correct facts, which misleads us and leaves us with wrong thinking. Parents have an idea of what they want their children to learn about and what they want to wait to teach their kids about. The saying '@CAPS1 is a right time for everything', fits this situation very well. Ages come along and the older you are the more responsible you can be. Books have allowed children and even toddlers to become exposed to curse words and intercourse and situations where they should not have the chance to discover at such a young age. We all think well the library isn't the only place where children are exposed it is the people throughout this world, but if we could cut down one resource where they could have limits on what to research and explore than it would suit the communities benificial. Children get caught up in places and habits at such an early age, but in order to manage the number of children who go through this we need to take pride in ourselves and have the nerve to stand up to all the rest of the adults and bring this issue to eye. The books that are put out with such topics such as illegal substances or intercourse or curse words should only be available to children at an appropriate age. We need to take the time and realize that maybe we do need to bring this situation to the attention of the adults throughout each community to give them the chance to put a better input on our children these days. These extreme censory should be limited and not just put out for people of all ages. I believe that we do need to go through experiences but are children getting pregnant at the age of and kids doing drugs in early years of middle school. We adults have possibly allowed these habits to become exposed to the younger generation when they have done nothing but influenced the children with a bad habit. The small things that we do not think about are the ones that put the most impact upon the young people. I understand that they want to explore and have the life experiences to learn from, but these past twenty years has changed so much that it is hard to believe. are parents who cuse infront of kids which gives the child the thought of it being alright. Well news flash children and young adults should not be using this language or have those type of reactions to situations. Many children learn it from the people that they are around, the books they read, the media they watch and now basically it is available to all. Information is easy to get ahold of these days. This society should come to realization that the time has come where we need to take a stand and do the young generation a great deed in the benefit and show them what is truely right and less dangerous. Some children are headed down a hard road and each child needs a motivation and a person to be when they get caught in these situations. We all need someone to help us understand our wrong doings. But the censorship needs to come to a limit, and not be so available to just anyone. Things need to change and without the reacting of the older individuals we can not help this change.

5792,2,"If I were to write a newspaper artical about books, movies, cds, or magazines that should be taken off the shelf this is what I would write. There are many items that should be revealed to younger viewers but one person cannot stop that it would take awhile for that to happen. Many movies, cds, books, and magazines have on them the age that you should be where they think you are mature enough to view or listen to. Half the stuff they make avaliable to younger viewers are appropiate for them but for instance half the time you can't control what your children watch, yes some companies such as and have parental control where you can block shows but just plain cable. I think the shows that they put on now days are very inappropate for younger viewers. Take and the they are putting those shows on channels it isn't right for little kids to be watching these types of shows. When I was younger we had and those were all appropiate for younger viewers. They didn't talk about sexual, violance, or any bad points where all those shows such as that is a good show for younger kids they have a on there cusing, flicking people off, shooting guns. People probably don't want to come in the house to thier toddler cusing, or holding a gun because it is okay at any age to just cus at somebody or flick them off let alone holding a gun. Yes hunting uses a gun but who takes there or year old hunting. I know for a fact I wouldn't. They are putting all kinds of bad views and examples out there for younger kids. Yes there are parents out there that could care less what their children are doing and yes it is very wrong.

5793,2,"I believe that a book, magazine, movie, etc., should not be removed if it is found offensive to parents. If children are taking books off the shelf that they shouldn't then maybe the books should be organized by age. There are two main reasons why i believe that censoring books is unessecary. First, it cost more money. Second, there are computers that are just as convenient these days. I think that censoring books could start to add up and be a lot of money. Libraries need to put more effort into buying books then buying censors for books because if there were more children books maybe they wouldn't be so eager to read something they know there not suppose to. If the shelves of books were organized by age maybe it would decrease problems. For example: put the unnapropiate books up high where younger children are not exposed. There is nothing wrong with wanting to read a great book, but we have to realize that computers are more convenient and sometimes quicker to find information. So censorship is unessecary in most cases. Libraries are local places that children, teens, and adults enjoy going to find a great book to read, and by censoring the books, it starts to be a hassel to the people that just want to spend time drifting into a suspenseful, love, or even horror book",8608,8609.0,I believe book  magazine  movie  etc  removed found offensive parents  If children taking books shelf nt maybe books organized age  There two main reasons believe censoring books unessecary  First  cost money  Second  computers convenient days  I think censoring books could start add lot money  Libraries need put effort buying books buying censors books children books maybe would nt eager read something know suppose  If shelves books organized age maybe would decrease problems  For example  put unnapropiate books high younger children exposed  There nothing wrong wanting read great book  realize computers convenient sometimes quicker find information  So censorship unessecary cases  Libraries local places children  teens  adults enjoy going find great book read  censoring books  starts hassel people want spend time drifting suspenseful  love  even horror book
5794,2,"Censoring books can be looked at in many different ways. There are reasons why they should be censored, and also many reasons why they shouldn't. Parents and teachers have to realize that kids are going to be exposed to bad things sooner or later in their life. The sooner it is, the more mature it makes them at a younger age. The real world is a place full of sex, drugs, and alcohol. Teenagers are fully aware of the dangers of these things, and part of the reason is due to books they found when they were kids in their local library. By censoring books, it shelters kids from the real world. Therefore, when they grow up and become older, they're not really prepared for it. Although seeing these things at a young age could make kids curious, it could also make them easier to convince that those things are wrong. Some authors are bound to be offended if their books get censored from libraries. All authors have reasons as to why they write what they write. Some books are for the pure enjoyment for people, while others contain facts that could help people. If I were an author and my book got censored, i would be greatly offended. Although kids are young and have not yet been introduced to the hard things life puts you through, they should still have a say in what they read. By taking away all the 'bad' books, you're allowing the childen to only read one type of book. No child wants to only be able to read books about little princesses and flowers. Also, whose to say that any books are good enough for their children to read? Everyone has different opinions, which is why you should allow everyone to have a say, including kids. Taking away books that appeal to them is taking away a part of their freedom. Eventually all kids will grow into adults and be introduced to the real world. By letting them read books about the real world, it gives them an idea of what it is like and better prepares them for it. Censoring books not only takes away the right of kids around the world, but also the authors. Authors have a say in what the write, therefore children should have a say in what they read. Books about the things they will experience when they're older will open their eyes up and make them realize that the world is a hard place",8610,8611.0,Censoring books looked many different ways  There reasons censored  also many reasons nt  Parents teachers realize kids going exposed bad things sooner later life  The sooner  mature makes younger age  The real world place full sex  drugs  alcohol  Teenagers fully aware dangers things  part reason due books found kids local library  By censoring books  shelters kids real world  Therefore  grow become older  re really prepared  Although seeing things young age could make kids curious  could also make easier convince things wrong  Some authors bound offended books get censored libraries  All authors reasons write write  Some books pure enjoyment people  others contain facts could help people  If I author book got censored  would greatly offended  Although kids young yet introduced hard things life puts  still say read  By taking away bad  books  re allowing childen read one type book  No child wants able read books little princesses flowers  Also  whose say books good enough children read  Everyone different opinions  allow everyone say  including kids  Taking away books appeal taking away part freedom  Eventually kids grow adults introduced real world  By letting read books real world  gives idea like better prepares  Censoring books takes away right kids around world  also authors  Authors say write  therefore children say read  Books things experience re older open eyes make realize world hard place
5795,2,"The censorship of certain books, movies, magazines, etc. has been becoming a problem in libraries. Some people don't want their kids being able to check them out. There are a few ways to fix this problem. First, I believe that this isn't a huge issue. Those certain books, movies, and magazines are there for a purpose. Some people think differently. They don't want their children taking home 'dirty' books with bad things in them at such a young age. Second, books and movies with bad things in them are all over. They're not just at the library. If a child wants to look at one, they will either way. But some libraries should not have things like that in them. School labraries are one. It would be wrong for a teen to go down to the library, pick up an uncesored magazine, and go sit down to look at dirty pictures. Next, people use books and movies like that for different reasons. To teach and use in a class is one of them. And i'm not saying just in a school classroom. To fix this problem I believe that on those certain books there should be an age limit to to where you can check them out. They should be placed away from other books and movies so kid's can't get ahold of them. In conclusion, I believe this is not a huge issue. Books and movies with bad things are all over not just in a library. Also people use these books, magazines, and movies for many reasons.

In my own experiences of movies are that they can give you an imagitive image in your head. With music I can read about all kinds of music around the world and with magazines I can read about different cultures. From my own observation on music, movies, and magazines I found them very reliable resources and very unique books because they can give you ideas of careers you want to do in life and they can also can give you a different outlook of life.

Authors have the right to make their work exactly how they want it, without beeping out, blurring out, or taking out pieces of work. Some of these topics are more profound than others, but I believe that it is part of life. When a child walks into a public library, there should be no way of them getting their hands on a book that has bad language or pictures in it. If an author writes a kids book with profound language, I believe they shouldn't have the right to put it on the kids shelf, let alone publish it. I think that there should be an area strictly for kids and an area for teenagers and adults, but taking out materials just for kids is wrong in my opinion. If kids aren't supposed to see it, don't write it! Kids in this day and age grow up a lot faster than how it ust to be. Their vocabulary widens just by listening to the radio. Yes, most songs on the radio are edited, but only to a certain degree. The really bad words are changed, but words that kids already know the meanings to are still in the song. I believe that if one bad word is going to be changed they all should be, and thats not how it is. I learned half of the bad language I know from listening to the radio when I was younger, but that doesn't make me a bad kid for knowing the words. Kids know what is right and what is wrong, and taking books off shelves because their 'bad' is not the right thing to do. People have to be mature about what they see and read, regardless of their age. If you learn new words or see things you know you shouldn't see, it's not about you seeing it, it's how you react to what you've seen or heard. This is why I think that censoring libraries is the wrong thing to do.

5799,2,"Censorship in libraries: or Censorship has been a huge controversy over many years within the entertainment world. It has been highly scrutinized in movies, music, magizines, and as well as books. Most people get books or magizines from local libraries or school libraries. Although many people feel that these books and magizines from libraries should by censored or taken off the shelf for explicit content the library should not have the right to censor certain books or magizines, because it is he or she who is reading the material who can make the judgment on if it will offend them, he or she has the ability to stop reading at any time if they do not like the book or magizine, and he or she has the freedom to choose any other book if they do not like that book. Censoring books and magizines within libraries is a because he or she choosing the book can make the decision on their own if it will offend them or not. Just because one person who reads a certain book gets offended by the content does not mean every other person who reads that same book will be offended. Every person in the world has their own opinion about everything, so why are we just censoring the libraries when people could get offended by certain things by just walking down the street. It should be the individual deciding if he or she wants to read a certain book, not the library deciding that it will offend somebody and taking it off the shelf. In addition to the fact that it should be the individual's choice whether he or she will read a certain book or magizine, censoring books or magizines in libraries is wrong because he or she has the freedom to stop reading a book or magizine at any time. Nobody is forcing them to read a certain book or magizine and if he or she does feel offended at any point throughout reading then they can close the book and take it back no questions asked. Why punish those people who do like the book or magizine just because it have some explicit content? If you do not like the book or magizine then just close it and take it back, but do not make the library take it off the shelf. Finally, censoring certain books and magizines in libraries is wrong because the individual choosing the book or magizine has an entire library full of books and magizines to choose from. Not all books and magizines have explicit content and so if the person thinks they not like a certain book or magizine all they have to do is go find another, it is that simple. He or she should skim the book or magizine and if they fell uncomfortable about what is in it, then he or she can put it down and find another that they will like more. In conclusion censoring certain books or magizines in libraries is wrong, because the individual choosing to read this book or magizine can tell whether or not it will offend them and if so they can not read it. Also censoring is a because any point throughout reading this book or magizine the individual has the freedom to close the book and stop reading. Lastly censoring in libraries is a because the individual has an entire library to choose a book or magizine from, because not all books or magizines have explicit content.",8620,8621.0,Censorship libraries  Censorship huge controversy many years within entertainment world  It highly scrutinized movies  music  magizines  well books  Most people get books magizines local libraries school libraries  Although many people feel books magizines libraries censored taken shelf explicit content library right censor certain books magizines  reading material make judgment offend  ability stop reading time like book magizine  freedom choose book like book  Censoring books magizines within libraries choosing book make decision offend  Just one person reads certain book gets offended content mean every person reads book offended  Every person world opinion everything  censoring libraries people could get offended certain things walking street  It individual deciding wants read certain book  library deciding offend somebody taking shelf  In addition fact individual s choice whether read certain book magizine  censoring books magizines libraries wrong freedom stop reading book magizine time  Nobody forcing read certain book magizine feel offended point throughout reading close book take back questions asked  Why punish people like book magizine explicit content  If like book magizine close take back  make library take shelf  Finally  censoring certain books magizines libraries wrong individual choosing book magizine entire library full books magizines choose  Not books magizines explicit content person thinks like certain book magizine go find another  simple  He skim book magizine fell uncomfortable  put find another like  In conclusion censoring certain books magizines libraries wrong  individual choosing read book magizine tell whether offend read  Also censoring point throughout reading book magizine individual freedom close book stop reading  Lastly censoring libraries individual entire library choose book magizine  books magizines explicit content

5802,2,"People's personality and taste are different among various things. Some people like the color blue and others pink. Then there are some people that find it very offensive if you like something other than what they had in mind. We run into those people every so often. Certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I believe should be viewed by your own decision and if someone has a problem with it, so be it. They are not the ones reading it, you are. People like to have power. If you give them a little of something they will try for more. For example, one time I had just finished this really great book. I had told this one individual that I thought this book was really good and that they should try it out. She did, but she found it very offensive to the female race. So, she told the librarian about her objections to this book and pretty soon, the whole series was gone. I was very angry. I thought that was wrong because other peope have different takes on different stories that you read. Music is another controvercial thing you have to be careful of. Certain people take certain music the wrong way. The way you view a song be different form another persons perspective. This is also true for movies. People today can make their own decisions for themselves, if they view the information they receive as offensive they have to take the other persons perspective befor you go and pass judgement on the topic at hand. Also, you have to keep in mind a lot of what is heard is not all true. People who go to the library have a problem with very opinionated statements that form when people have read a book, viewed a movie, or listened to certain music. To truly develope an opinion of your own you are going to have to be that one that makes your desicion of how you feel about the book, movie, or music. However, you can not do that if peple are constantly pulling things off the shelf. Now, that does not seem fair does it? As a person standing back seeing how people get offensive over certain things they read, listen to, and see I began to wonder if they even know if it is at all true before they go and make a judgement because they are offended.

Life will take its toll later on and hit them hard if there being hidden away from the real world.Generally music is not that bad in a libary there racist and sexist comments within the music offend some and others it doesn't bother them a bit.

Turning off the real things in life that is violent, disgusting and to bad for our delicit eyes to see will for sure not do you any good. Imagine if your yr old walks into a libary and picks up a book on something you are to embarresed to talk about or say like lets say a racey book about a berlisque in the and im sure the parent will feel embarressed and not how to approach the situation correctly; but its ok to tell your kids the truth and not make it seem like the world is full of rainbows and butterflies and little smiley faces.

5805,2,"Censorship the blockage of reading or viewing certain materials. There are many things that could be said about censorship. Some say that offensive material should be removed and some say it should stay. In my mind there is merit in both arguments. In this world there is material that is offensive, but if you hide the material people will never learn from it and understand it. If it is just being offensive to be offensive then it should be removed, but if it there to serve a purpose such as teaching a art some believe offensive then that is wrong. To remove a story or film that shows offensive material that has a purpose is slowly killing the world of knowledge. Without the knowledge stored in much of this material the world would be much worse of. For example if we removed all books and movies about the the world would begin to forgot the great horrors and some day repeat them. In the book '@CAPS2 the world technologically has improved but intellectually has declined. Technology has many uses in that future but books are no longer allowed to be read. Although it is commiting a crime many in that world still choose to read books. At the start of the story the protaganist does not understand why these people risk so much just to read a book. Throughout the book he then starts to realize that the world needs the knowledge stored in the books to stop the world from repeating its mistakes over again and he began to realize the power books can have. Censorship can also have its good points also though. For example a pornographic movie adds nothing to world and it is offensive so that has a reason to have censorship over it, but censorship can also be used by governments to keep materials the government dosn't approve out of the peoples hands and limiting freedom. Overall censorship has some low and high points. The low points are it limits freedom and blocks knowledge that world should learn. The high point of it is it blocks offensive material from being shown to children and other's who don't wish to see it.

Other people might like that book, but they would never get the chance to enjoy it since its been takin off the shelves do to some mildly offensive terms.

Yes, some people think they are offensive, but just because they think those things are offensive doesn't mean that everyone does. Keeping them in a diffrent section would be the appropriate thing to do, but to just completely take them off the shelf wouldn't be the way to handle it. Some people like what those things reprisent, or agree with them. If some people feel that the certain books, movies, ect.. come off as offensive then rather then completely taking them off the shelf. Those items could just be moved to a section of their own. That way people who are actually instrested in them, and are wanting those types of things could still get them. For those who don't agree with them don't have to deal with them. The problem could be solved just like that. Since they do come off as offensive to some, that doesn't mean that everyone will think that way. Others like what they say and want that type of book, magazine, or anything like that. Everybody has their own opinion on things and see things in a diffrent way. Just because one person see's it as offensive doesn't mean every one will. I'm sure that most of the people who created these things that are seen as offensive are not intending for them to come off in that way.

5810,2,"I do not think that people should be able to censor what people read, watch, look at, or even listen to. This is a free country and if people start to tell you that you can't listen to that song or read that book then it would be contradicting the constitution. My first point is, if don't want their children to listen to music then they are being over protective! Yeah it might say offensive stuff and yeah there might be alot of foul language but it's not like the kid is going to go out and kill someone or do drugs after they listen to or Most kids listen to rap so it will get them pumped up for a test or a big game. As a swimmer I listen to rap alot, wether i'm in the locker room or out behind a block stretching before a big race. The point is the music is meant to get people pysched not to become a druggy. My second point is about the movies. Movies play a big role in the part of entertaining people when they are bored maybe even sad or they just want to see the newest comedy. Movies sometimes effect how people think but it doesn't make them go crazy!! I'm definatly not telling to let the kid watch what ever he/she wants to watch. There should be a limit but i'm also not saying that a old has to watch let the kid watch something like or It will amaze the kid if he watches to be honest it would be quite interesting to see a old running around thinking he's just make sure he doesn't jump off of the roof like him. My third and final point is about books. Books effect our society, not only does it entertain you but it also makes you smarter and more aware of things. My always told me to read as much as I can so that I would become smarter. After i let that process in my mind, I started bring home the first book when I was only nine and then they told me that it was too violent and it just made me mad so I quit reading all the time!! Yeah I was being childish but people just can't do that to there precious kids!! So as you can see, should let their children listen to anything or read anything or even watch anything!

5811,2,"There has always been problems with censorship in our libraries see an offensive book in any way and pshhhh they it goes. If you find that offensive this is not the right read for you. There are some good reasons for getting rid of certain material from the shelves of a librairy. There are some things that you certainly wouldn't want a child to see or read like any kind of material with (adult content) so with those books off of the shelves that would solve that problem. Although some would want to read the material that you just through off of the shelves. Just put it in a section that who want to read it can. witthout children being exsposed to it. It is somewhat annoying though that we have to have adult sections in video stores so seeing them in a librairy would just be sad. There is not allot of books that would have anythinng like that though I would think. If the material is exsplicit then it needs removed because all it is going to do is get hooked on things they dont want to be hooked on. There are some bad reasons that also go along with censorship, there are going to be problems with religious books. Some would say they didnt want to see books on the shelves that are contrary to their belifes no matter what they are. Those kind of books on the other hand couldnt be removed. I think about what hitler did when they gathered up as many as they could find and burned them, I would hate to see it come to that exstreme. Some christians would say get rid of books like the quran or other false practice books but muslims, budists, hindus, and othe would say the same things about christians so no one wins on that matter. Another bad thing about it is if you were in charge of the librairie or even higher up then that you could regulate what books could and couldn't go on the shelves. My oppinion on this whole thing is that no one can get rid of religouse books. Also I would say that in my oppinion that you should have different places to put books.

Books have been made for many years, since the era.As time passes by we still read those books from way back and talking about horrible things, but does that mean they have to take away history. People do not realize that books are worth more than treasure. It is a peice of the past and history is important to our lives so we can go back and research what they have done. Most offensive books have a meaning and a moral ending. Offensive writting in magazines is not all bad, most of it tells what is going on in our world and and tell the people how to solve problems. Maybe some offensive books should be removed but some of these materials tell us what happenes in life.

It's not fair to the people who like the book. If you don't like it or find it offensive, don't read it! It's not that hard to just pass it up or read another book. If you have children, I know you want to keep them safe from reading bad books. All you have to do is go with them to the library. Make sure that you read the back of the book to see what it is about. You could also check with your librarian to make sure it is a good book for your childs age range.

Its acually quit the contrary, reading about that kind of stuff acually enriches us in making are own decison. It teaches us about many things that most will not want to talk about, and how are you expose to know if you want to do it or not if you know nothing about it. Now this my sound like encourging the use of drugs but not at all, simply just staing that about something and doing it are totatoly differnt things that should be taklen into prespective. SO i think anyone has the right to pick up a book and enjoy enriching their lives with differnt cultrals, such as which is one of the all time most imnportant books to read.

5816,2,"Can every book be offensive? Books can be offensive to some people, but others not feel that way. Many books are a way of the author expressing their inner thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Some people like the way some books are. That does not mean they are trying to offend others. Everyone has their own opinion on what they like to read. Libraries have different sections of books, so that if someone does not like the type of book then they just do not have to go in that section of the library. Many libraries around here have different floors for adults, teens, and children. If a parent does not like their child reading books, or seeing movies that are not appropiate, then they should not take them in that area. Many do not understand what some of these books can do to their child's mind. They might get the wrong impression. Personally, I do not think that those books should be removed. If every single book that someone thought was offensive, then pretty much every book would be removed off the shelves. That is not fair to someone who possibly enjoys the book. It is their choice on what they like to read. No one else should have an opinion on that. i understand when parents say they want to take every inapropriate books, movies, music magazines, etc., off the shelf; they are just protecting their children. However, the books people read are what they like to read, and others should not judge or discimiate them for their choices. Think, if every book offended someone, then maybe taking it off the shelf could offend someone else. So this is a lose-lose situation.

The books and magazines in the library should not be offensive but it is not like poeple really take that much offense to it, becuase it is just a story being told. Nothing real. Movies have a lot of bad offensive things in them and so do song but if you do not like them then you should not watch or listen it. Movies show kids how to do anything but if their parents watch them as they grow up, then they would not do what their parent did not want them to do. If you take one bad book or movie off the shelf then they should take away most of the stuff in the library. There are some offensive stuff in there but there are also other stuff you can look at that is not that bad. Music is the same way, if it talks about bad things then you do not have to listen to it. People listen to what they like to hear, if they did not like it then they could listen to something other than rap, like country or heavy metal. We did not make up the songs, books, or movies we just watch them or listen to them. Let kids watch something better than offensive things.

5818,2,"Books that are offensive to anyone should be taken off shelves of every library and/or book store. Everyone should have the opportunity to read things that interest them without any offensive content. This goes for music, movies, magazines, etc. No one should have to experience degrading texts that are offensive to a certain race or background. Why should someone sit and read a book off your library shelves that they find offensive? This is a question that will go on to have many different answers, and multiple views on the whole subject. If a library contains content that is a 'slap in the face' to a particular person who reads it, then that library shouldn't carry the books on their shelves anymore. When people come and visit the library it's sometimes for leisure activity or just to get some work done, either way libraries shouldn't provide offensive text to anyone. People also find some music and movies offensive, too. To avoid not pleasing your customers, libraries should get rid of all the books, music, movies, etc., off their shelves and try to think about if they were in the shoes of the people who felt offended. Ask yourself, what would I do if I felt that the material in your library offends me? If so, try to have some concern for other people.

5819,2,"Many people find certain materials on the shelves in libraries offensive, while others not. It just depends on the kind of person you are and how offensive the material be. In my opinion, I believe that materials that are offensive to some people should be kept on the shelves. I have a few reasons for my opinion. The first one is because some people find those materials offensive to them, but some other people find them interesting. If something offends somebody, then they shouldn't look at it. For example, if one who finds a book about trying to eat healthier thinks it is offending people who are overweight, the other think the opposite. A different person might see that book in a positive way and actually might help people eat healthier. Another reason I have for my opinion with keeping materials that be offensive to people in a library is the author or musician, etc. have worked hard on it. I don't believe that many people who have worked hard on something would not want people to just throw it away. In the third grade, I made a poetry book, and I worked extremely hard on it. I wanted people to look at it and give my credit for my hard work. I have one last reason for my preference. That is that many people might believe that certain offensive materials should be taken away because they don't think children should be seeing or listening to it. Well, if someone has that opinion, we should respect it. Although, I do think that parents should be more responsible if they have this opinion. They should be sure that their child is reading and listening to things that are appropriate for their age. In conclusion, everybody has their own opinions. In the situation of people debating if offensive materials should be removed from the shelves of a library, I disagree. I believe that some people find materials offensive, while other do not. if people find those materials interesting, then we should respect their preference. We should also give people credit for their hard work that they have put into these materials whether they are offensive or not. Also, I think that parents should be more responsible wit their children if they think materials be offensive to them.

5821,2,"Everyone in this world has their own thoughts about different materials of work. Some music is found offensive because of the profanity and the bad things they talk about. Movies are often found bad too. Movies that contain sexual scenes can be seen as bad and not right. I feel that movies like that should be banned from the I grew up way out in the country and was brought up the country way listening to country music and watching old westerns. I believe thats how all people should have been raised. They do not need to go to their public library and seen music cases with bad names or movies about sexual scenes. I believe that movies like that should be banned and some songs should be for certain ages levels. Most city kids and adults think songs about sex and getting high is the best music in the world, but thats their opinion. I feel like it is wrong for them to love that kind of music. Another bad thing to see on the shelves of a library are magazines exploiting drugs, alcohol, and pornography. Little kids looking for books grab a hold of one of these magazines and think they are not doing anything bad til an adult finds out and they get in trouble. I hate to see kids have that happen to them. Libraries should be used for books only, not movies and bad stuff. They should be used for reading, information, and relaxig. It is just a sad thing to see when you go to a library and see someone wanting bad magazines or movies. Some libraries offer games to relax and I find that very helpful, but some of the games can become loud and obnoxious and should not be aloud in libraries. Only puzzles and drawings should be aloud. I know that when I go to the library to relax that I do not want a group of kids hooping and hollering while I try to read. That is my alone time and I feel it should be respected. I know that everyone has their own opinions about things and I just wanted to share to the people of town what I thought our library should be like. It should be a fun, yet relaxing place to be.

5822,2,"Libraries have all kinds of books and some people think that they are offensive to children. If libraries did not have a variety of books children would not be able to learn new stuff. Children enjoy reading, watching movies, and reading magazines and that information almost always stays in their mind for when they need it. If some stuff in movies or books from the library are offensive then it is the parents responsibility to teach them what is right and what is wrong. In my opinion, libraries are not bad for children in any way. It is a learning and peaceful environment for them to work in. Libraries provide so much information that we are very lucky to have that kind of resource. Children learn in many different ways and the library encourages them to work the best they can. Smaller children like books that contain bigger and more colorful pictures and it is what gets their attention the most. Libraries would not have things that could harm children in any way. Some children go to the library because they like to read in a peaceful place. Others want to go there to rent movies because they dislike movies. Some like reading magazines and others the newspaper. Libraries can only do so much for children, it is up for them if they want to learn new things to be better at school and in the future. If parents think that some stuff in the library is bad for their children then they need to do something about it. Parents can talk to their children about the things they should avoid at the libray. If kids are still in elementary school then they need to get books or movies according to their age. Parents need to be careful on what kind of movies children pick out. They can tell their children how the library works and what stuff they need to avoid according to their age. My views on libraries are good and I do not think they should remove any of the stuff they have in there. The materials people use at the library is a choice, nobody is forced to go there if they do not want to. From my experience, I think that the library is a wonderful place for studying or doing homework. I have been there and it has everything a person needs to get things done. Movies, books, magazines, newspapers, internet, and many more things are the resources we get from the library. Libraries are not offensive to children or to anyone. It is up to the people on how they take advantage on it. My observations have shown that libraries are there to help us and to make things easier for everyone.

5823,2,All over the world there are librarys with many diffrent books where the list can be endless. The books can be about a very broad topic or narrowed down to a specific topic about a plant life. Today there can be more than just any book or magazine writing about something amazing. People are stepping up for there rights and many books are publishing some books that can be offencive to many people and there culture. Books help us understand so many things. Yes they can have some bad words about people but that is a part of history. If the librarys censor the books to much then the world will try to eliminate the history that has happen. I think that if the people who are getting offended should try to understand that they are just helping others understand what happen in the past or happen in the future. Say for example the libray in your community has cencored the books that you can't find anything you are trying to get for a specific book project then what do you do? How are you suppost to write a paper on history in the when the library has no books on record about that subject. There can be many pros and cons about censoring ship but it should be the persons choice to read the book and decide if its ok to keep reading it or just put it back down. There will always be some sort of article or book about something that a person get offended by but it just shows how that person can misunderstand a subject.

5824,2,"Libraries should be divided into different sections for kids and adults. the library should have the adult sections blocked off from the kids. Then the parents wouldn't have to worry about ther kids looking at or reading somthing that thy're no suppose to. Stores are suppose to ask for an when a person buys movies or games with an age rate on them but most times they dont. The reason why the kids act the way the do is because of the media they listen to and watch. If the media was so bad the kids wouldn't be.

5825,2,"To whom it concern, Certain Materials that shouldn't be Removed to the library or any place where books are for public use are there for a reason. These books get put on the shelves because the author or artists want to express to the world about their story. It be offensive towards some, but it is your choice whether to listen or not. I do not think that libraries should ban certain materials because different people interpret material in different ways. The point of authors and artists are to spread a story throughout the world. They are different and that is what makes them an artist. If we take that away then we are taking away their freedom of speech. Saying what you want when you want is a choice. Hearing and analyzing what it means is a different situation. Besides everyone is entitlted to their own opinion. I've noticed these days people state their opinion but not everyone will agree. For example, a person be offended by some sayings in a song, while another person maybe can relate to the artists. People are different because they are diverse. Materials are different because they come from diverse and different poeple. Certain materials are also in relation to readers and listeners. The artists or author is speaking to reach out to billions of people. Artists or authors are speaking up for people who can't or refuse to say how they feel. My opinion and someone else's could be the same or couldn't be the same. Based on the quote from Katherine Paterson,'...But if I have the right toremove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--...And then we have no books left for us.' I agree with that statement from the quote. If everyone had to state their opinion on why they wouldn't that book on the shelf any more then there are no more books for anyone. Not everyone agree on the same book, song, movie, etc. Removing a book that is offensive to a certain group of poeple, might be a book that is great to others. Usually the books I read or the music I listen to I enjoy it. I don't like some lines or words that they include in other songs that I try not to listen to. I chose to not read or listen to those material. I will not take the book off the shelf or ban the song from the world, because that is taking away everyone's opinion on certain things. In conclusion, I think that banning certain materials from libraries, radio stations, movie theatres, etc. are taking away a person freedom lof creativity. These artists would no longer be able to express themselves. One person might find it offensive, but another person relate to it. My opinion and another person's opnionion not be the same, or be the same, but we are still different people. We shoudn't base it off of one or two opinions because that is offedning another persons opinion on that certain book, song or movie. Living in a world without diversity and difference is like living in a world with no color, or no library. That is what a library colorful is the different books inside it.

How child will know that something is bad if parents alows them to do whatever they wont? To teach child, words are less important than some things what we are doing in reality. This idea is very comen among the kids, sometimes I am fallowing the steps of my father, even if I know that they are wrong. Even if we need to teach our childrens throu whole our life, the best age according to the science is to teach child to do right things around their five years of age.

5829,2,"Is Many of us have picked up a magazine or a book, or maybe even flipped through tv stations only to come across a topic we find offensive. On tv, even the child-friendly channels are beginning to speed up with the image that partying and alcohol are the 'in' or right thing to do. In music, you can find artists speaking on subjects they have no knowledge of or right to be talking about. There seems to be no way out but do people not know their limits? Age, race, and religion inappropriate movies, music, magazines and books are more popular than ever. Censorship has missed its queue. Not to long ago, my old brother had been watching a movie. Curious as to what he was watching, I sat next to him, only to be surprised at what my eyes would see; A popular artist singing a song, with year old teens dancing around with red and blue plastic cups in hand. Huh? Where is the or the that I expected? Being a teen myself, I wasn't suprised at the scene that played before me but I was shocked for the fact that my brother, who hadn't even hit puberty and still read books with my mother at night, was having to watch this. I would think the adults who cast and produce these movies would have a better idea of what kids should be watching instead of pressuring them into feeling that they need to speed up and do adult activities. Another incident of how desperate censorship is needed, brings me to my example of racism. After recently watching a game show, were a volunteer judge would not give the prize to a worthy contestant because of his race baffled me. The man blatantly stated that, based on his experiences, he doesn't like people of this race. This comment angered the panel of judges seated around him. Each asking their own version as to why this man did not like people of a different race and the man replying with an uneducated and uninformed answer. Situations like these, where people are discriminatory for no logical or serious reason, do not deserve to be broadcasted on tv. Accepting people of all races is big part my life and never have I been or planned to be prejudice against someone who, for all I know, could be just like me. Shows such as the one mentioned above should not be allowed on tv. I do not have a personal experience with religious discrimination but I have come across on tv. Many of the situations I see are of people degrading a religion because of their own personal opinion. People are entitled to their won beliefs and moral systems, so not everyone's will be the same. Pressuring people of another or no religion is something that movies and shows need to work on as well. No religion is better than the other but equal.

5830,2,"is right, 'all of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' If i say, i do believe that the people have the right to keep books, records, and videos filled with profound contents. It's all about the money to the consumer, and the ambition to full fill the desireable traits to the buyer. However if such an exsplicit object was to reach children, I certainly must agree that it would be outrageous not allow this subject to go uncensored. The child's brain must need time to sprout. For a child to be exposed to this type of prophanity, they would practically be polluting the brain, causing severe health damages, and would be ruining the indevity of for years to come. When a child reaches a certain age, it's necassary that they should have the opiton to be exposed to the dangers in music, books, television, and magazines. However all of those materials can also be harmful. You'd mirrorly be polluting your own brain to reach you unitellectual desires. Children all over the globe are exposed to these type of issues, and it needs to be stopped. When children watch television hours a day, they're not only losing brain cells and causing health issues, they're making bad choices. If they see a attractive seleberty on the tv smoking, they bring in the possibility that smoking be okay. However we all know its not. Such profanity ruins the brain.

No matter what the subject should be they should have the right to research it just like you would with anything else. How would you be able to say what is acceptible and what isn't, where would you draw the line? In the past dictators, like have used censorship to withold information from their people. If you keep books from people that would be just like the burning books to stop people from being informed and the world, it would be like making everyone think the same.

Even if you not think you have learned much you have you see things and don't even think about how they effect you. You can even benifit from noneducational films.

5832,2,"Do you think some books, movies, music, and magazines should not be read by children of a certain age ? Many people have different feelings on the subject but I think people of a certain age should be able to look at different things. Depending on the material in the book, movie, music, and etc. should depend on the censoring. Everyones opinion is different and that might effect their decision on what to let their children see and what they do let their children see. If you are a child you should not be able to look and learn about certain things like sex and drugs, but as you age and mature the more things you should be able to see. When kids are young in the library they have their own section of books that is seperate from the rest of the library books. This section contains things that children should be learning about such as sharing, making friends, and getting along with others. As these children go up in age the content in these books change. During the teenage years you can read books about breif sexual incounters, drugs and what they can do to you and things in that area. The things you should be able to see and check out in the library should be determined by age and maturity. I also think things your child can see should be determined by the parents because everyone has a different opinion on what their child can see. Some parents think it's fine for their child to read teen books about sex and drugs and others not like the idea. The maturity of the child is something I would consider. If I feel like my child is ready to read about those things then they are ready. Just because some people don't think it's the right thing for my child to be reading and learning about it is still my choice on choosing what my child can and can not learn about. Some people think if something is inappropriate it should not be in the library. That person feel like books about sex should not be the library at all and I feel like it should be because it is something that people must learn about. If every book someone thought was inappropriate was to be removed from libraries then there wouldn't be any books left to read. The purpose of the library is to learn about things and to research. If we remove everything inappropriate then there would be nothing left. Although the topics in some books are not appropriate for certain ages they will have to learn about it eventually because it is a part of life. In my opinion I think everything that are in libraries should stay on the shelves. If kids don't have the ability to learn about certain things in books, movies, and magazines they will have to learn about it in real life. I would rather have my children learn about things in books and things that they are not a part of rather then having to be in that situation in life and not know what to do when they get there.

Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and if they feel like their being offended they have every right to do something about.

My brother felt offended because he thought the movie was just for fun, he didnt understand the whole concept of showing the movie to learn what went on in slavery days.

Even that college student in a difficult anatomy class? Yes, the interenet is available to people now a days, but not all information is true. Things in books are more likely to be true than information on the internet. Books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should all be rated the same way.

5835,2,"I feel like libraries should not take things of the shelf because they find them offensive. The reason that I believe this is because not everyone finds the same things offensive. What one person finds offensive another person could find perfectly fine. With the books, magazines, movies, and even music you can tell and find out if it is going to be offensive to you. First, on books you are able to read a short summary on the back of the book. This will be able to tell you a little bit about the book. You should be able to tell from that if it is going to be offensive or not. If you think it is fine and won't be offensive then read the book. Also, if you think that the book will be offensive then don't read it. It really isn't up to anyone else to decide what you read. Second, with magazines it is pretty much the same thing. If you believe there is a magazine that is offensive just try not to look at it. Even though with magazines there are a lot that are offensive, but we really can't do anything about them. You could try putting them in another place, so that if you are trying not to offend someone they won't be offended if they can't see them. Then you have the movies. This is a place that alot of people can find things to be offensive. The reason this is because there are many offensive things. You never know what you are going to see if you turn on a movie true, but they put information about the movie out. This will allow you to know a little bit about what you are about to watch. Even though that doesn't really help it is there to have. A reason that I believe they shouldn't be pulled from shelves is because some people like to watch only those kind of movies. It would be easier to just put them in another place so you know where they are, but the people who don't want to see them don't have to. Then you have music. Music probably is the one that people want pulled the most. The reason I say this is because there is a lot of language and dirty things that are in music now. You never kneo exactly what you are listening to. This can create a problem. It can becasue of all that is said, but you don't have to pull it off the shelves. just because something has strong language and implies the wrong thing doesn't mean you have to pull it. It is just as simple to place it in a place that people who want to listen to it can, and just listen to the music that you want to. You are a person and you know what kind of things you like and dislike. Most of the things that libraries want to pull there is a good reason for wanting to. It can be anything simple from don't want kids listening or reading the wrong thing to just not wanting it there because it is what you want. I believe that they shouldn't pull things off of the shelves, but I don't understand why we can't just work something out so we all get to read and listen to what we want. In conclusion, I think that they shouldn't pull things off the shelves. They shouldn't be able to tell you what you can or can't read.

(For ).'Your doesn't neccesserely mean that they are talking about 'drugs ' because not true an expression that they give to the book and the person who going to read so can be interesting. In Other words if kids underage are getting books that are not appropiate for them they shouldn't be where they are not suppost to be , that's why they are sections for kids, teenagers and adults. if they are going to check out a book that they like just by looking at the title. by reading the introduction gives you a little hint of what the book about they like , they will check out. Also, if kids want to read about the military , about drugs , sex etc., that something normal about life, that means that they want to learn what going on , this not something new everybody has the curiousity to do something, read something, or experience something. I wouldn't understand why parents would find offensive if they're child's are getting books that they are not suppose to unless they are not in the age of getting a book that not appropiate for them, in that case I don't think that the librarian would let them check out a book if they are not suppose too. I don't mind child checking out movies as long as they are appropiate movies, and magazines these to materials can help alot if you are in a history class or something like that movies help alot and the best place where you can find them in the library, if you have to a projeect you need a magazin to your project the library has that too, these materials are i the library for a reason and honestly, i wouldn't understand why parents wouldn't let there child check out something that they need.

5837,2,"Many people have been asking if censorship in libraries should be done. which means that some material such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed because they are offensive to people in some way. Each book is individually inspected and checked if it is approrpriate for that age of students, so this shouldn't be a problem at all. If so happens something offensive in the library does show up, it was most likely put there on purpose.Yes this is true and it does rarely happen. It is understandable that some books about history could be shown as offensive, but it is real and it is educational. If there is something offensive in the libraries that students shouldn't read, then yes, censorship libraries in school as much as is needed. Primarily, extremely graphic, offensive, or grusome piece of literature that is found in the library brings a bad image to the school/library. For example, suppose a student walks into the library and wants to pick up a magazine, and some how, a pornographic magazine appears. That kind of literature should not even be found in the school, and not in a library either. If a person from the school board or someone of importance comes to school to examine what students are reading, that school would get into a lot of trouble. Even books about history could be seen as offensive(to some extent) because it's and it already happened. Sure things that are read be 'hard to swallow' but it's something that was written to educate not discriminate. That is the first reason censorship in libraries should be allowed. Additionally, the literature in schools/libraries be racist or stereotypical. There are many books that portray this kind of writing, yet its presence is not very seen in school libraries. Books that have to do with gang violence or drugs also be offensive.For example, the book '@CAPS1 is about an ex-gangbanger from and yes it is available to read from school libraries for educational purposes, since it speaks about his and shows how being in a gang is horrible decision. Most people would not be offended by it, but there are students in gangs and they might be offended by it. Yes this is very hard to belive but it's the sad truth. Another example would be a book that talks about slavery, or immigration, maybe even The and that offend a lot of students, since their ethnicity was part of those events. Even though they pesonally were not part of it, maybe their family was.That could be a potentially good reason to censor libraries. Finally, not censoring students from reading material that is offensive to them, could put ideas into their minds, and even configure those ideas into their lives. A teenager's brain(in this case) is very drawn in to ideas that seem fun to them but are dangerous to their well-being. For example, let's say a student had never drank, smoked, etc. and they read a book about marijuana and decide to try it. Not exactly is it entirely the author's fault but it could of influenced what the student was thinking. Because of that the student be kicked out of school, or worse. Literature has a great influence on the generation of today, and that is extremely true. That is the final reason libraries should be censored of offensive material. In conclusion, libraries should be censored from graphic material because, it brings a bad image to schools or libraries. Another is that the material be racist or stereotypical to the reader. Then finally, it could put ideas into the student/reader's head and be applied into their lifestyles. censorship in libraries is no joke and should be taken seriously, to protect students and readers from material, that emotionally hurt them, and could even change their lives.",8696,8697.0,Many people asking censorship libraries done  means material books  magazines  etc  removed offensive people way  Each book individually inspected checked approrpriate age students  nt problem  If happens something offensive library show  likely put purposeYes true rarely happen  It understandable books history could shown offensive  real educational  If something offensive libraries students nt read  yes  censorship libraries school much needed  Primarily  extremely graphic  offensive  grusome piece literature found library brings bad image schoollibrary  For example  suppose student walks library wants pick magazine   pornographic magazine appears  That kind literature even found school  library either  If person school board someone importance comes school examine students reading  school would get lot trouble  Even books history could seen offensive  extent  s already happened  Sure things read hard swallow  s something written educate discriminate  That first reason censorship libraries allowed  Additionally  literature schoolslibraries racist stereotypical  There many books portray kind writing  yet presence seen school libraries  Books gang violence drugs also offensiveFor example  book   CAPS exgangbanger yes available read school libraries educational purposes  since speaks shows gang horrible decision  Most people would offended  students gangs might offended  Yes hard belive s sad truth  Another example would book talks slavery  immigration  maybe even The offend lot students  since ethnicity part events  Even though pesonally part  maybe family wasThat could potentially good reason censor libraries  Finally  censoring students reading material offensive  could put ideas minds  even configure ideas lives  A teenager s brain  case  drawn ideas seem fun dangerous wellbeing  For example  let s say student never drank  smoked  etc  read book marijuana decide try  Not exactly entirely author s fault could influenced student thinking  Because student kicked school  worse  Literature great influence generation today  extremely true  That final reason libraries censored offensive material  In conclusion  libraries censored graphic material  brings bad image schools libraries  Another material racist stereotypical reader  Then finally  could put ideas studentreader s head applied lifestyles  censorship libraries joke taken seriously  protect students readers material  emotionally hurt  could even change lives 
5838,2,"I believe Katherine is right. They should not take any books off of the shelves. Our children should have the same rights as people do now, they sould not hold them back to read the best authors out there. But I also think that Censorship sould be used in the school systems everywhere including high schools. There are some books out there that should be elimiated only for the fact of sexual preferances or bad profanity that should not be used. I would not want my child reading that and neither should you if you want to keep them out of all the bad stuff. The best books are the clean classics that have been around forever, not the books that are revolved around sex and drugs. If they are trying to keep that out of the schools then why should they have books over it... Whats the point in trying to stop it when there are books in the school system teaching them about it. I dont agree with a lot of the books in the librarys because of that reason. My perspective on books are different than others would be. But classics that have profanity that were okay to use back then are okay to have now. They should have censorship in the schools to just eliminate the books that are not nessesary for learning. Books are for expanding our mind but not going so far into learning about drugs. Like I said whats the point of trying to stop it in school if they are promoting it in the books in the school. I dont agree with having that in the school. Censorship is a good thing to have in a school setting to keep children from being under the inluence and safe. I would love to have in our school.

5839,2,"Author said, ' is always those certain books that parents hope their hcild never takes off the shelf.' parents believe some books don't belong inside the library because of the content inside book. I don't think books should be taken off the shelves just because someone doesn't agree with what the author wrote. Children know what they should and shouldn't read because of their common sense, but children are curious about alot of things. They all have to grow up one day. Even though are certain books and other types of media inside the library with explicit content I don't think they should be removed. Inside the library are sections that tell which type of genre the books are. Everybody is born with common sense and but some people don't use it. If you see a section that says adult , and you know you're not suppossed to read adult books then you shouldn't go to that section. I think that as long as the parent explains to their child that the things that happen inside those different types of media are some people's everyday life. They should also explain that doesn't mean it is okay for them to do also. Reading books like that is apart of growing up. As I got older I began to read the same books my read. I think the books helped me mature alot, because some of things I read I knew if I didn't use my brain I could possibly end up in the same situation. Therefore I don't think books should be removed because some things inside could be found offensive to people. If they feel that way they shouldn't let their child go inside the library alone, or to the undesired section alone. Even though your child has to grow up some day. I think the parents should let them read the books because they will have a outlook on what life is like for the people who don't have as much as them or have just as much but still surrounded by obstacles",8700,8701.0,Author said   always certain books parents hope hcild never takes shelf   parents believe books nt belong inside library content inside book  I nt think books taken shelves someone nt agree author wrote  Children know nt read common sense  children curious alot things  They grow one day  Even though certain books types media inside library explicit content I nt think removed  Inside library sections tell type genre books  Everybody born common sense people nt use  If see section says adult  know re suppossed read adult books nt go section  I think long parent explains child things happen inside different types media people s everyday life  They also explain nt mean okay also  Reading books like apart growing  As I got older I began read books read  I think books helped mature alot  things I read I knew I nt use brain I could possibly end situation  Therefore I nt think books removed things inside could found offensive people  If feel way nt let child go inside library alone  undesired section alone  Even though child grow day  I think parents let read books outlook life like people nt much much still surrounded obstacles
5840,2,"To think that we could remove public library books from the shelves because of the books being offensive is not a good idea. Our public libraries might as well be empty! The whole public is not goin to be pleased with all the materials at a public library. If books, magaznes, movies, etc. where removed from libraries the variety of materials would be limited. Books seen inappropriate for younger readers could be removed from the shelves. There needs to be a section for childrens' books to avoid children from picking up the wrong kind of book. There will always be content too graphic for children, but those books are to stay out of the children's section and in the adult section of a library. If the removal of books because they are to inapproriate for children, it would leave a lot less books for the adults. If the books where removed because they are offensive it leaves the opportunity to remove most of the books wide open. If religious groups found books about each other offensive then there goes religious books. A pacafist who doesn't like a graphic book on war, then it takes all those books out. The freedom we have to have a different opinion and with the removal of books found offensive would remove almost every book. Anyone can find any book offensive.

5841,2,"The issue of censorship is extremly conroversial amongst many people. There are many people that support both sides of this arguement and are very devoted to their side of the story. I, however, feel that censorship should not be enforced by law to the extent that they do. One reason I believe this way is that if the movie, magazine, book, etc. that a 'minor' is wanting to see or read, the parent of that child would be able to enforce that how they see fit. There are many parents that don't see an issue with their child watching an rated movie or playing an rated game, but just because are government feels it isn't appropriate, the child then has to get parent concent to be able to have access to these things. I feel that the parents know what they want and don't want their children having access to and they will monitor as they see fit. Another reason that I dont feel censorship is right is that the child is going to find these things out anyways and more then likely just find a way around the system that is set up to keep them out. There is no reason to shelter kids past a certain age, they are old enough and these things should be available to them, and if they dont find it appropriate or don't like it then they themselves will aviod those things without being told. Most kids in this generation know things that our government might find 'inappropriate' due to the internt, which just offers more and more ways around the system, but even with them knowing these things there hasn't been much of a change in our society. My final reason that i dont feel it is right is because the more you shelter your children the more likely they will be to do these things when they have access to all of these things that they are kept from. There are many people that say the game '@CAPS3 is not an appropriate game and it teaches violent tendancies, but this is not true, and I actualy feel that if you keep your kids from these things it will build up hostility then when they play those kind of games they feel it is alright to do those things because their parents have not taught them that what happens in some games or movies is not the way to deal with things. I feel there is no need to censor all of the media that they do to the extent that they do. There needs to be a limit on what they are able to censor and what age is put on the censors. There is no reason to block kids ot of these things because most of them already know about these things and have found a way to see these things that are classified as 'inappropriate'",8704,8705.0,The issue censorship extremly conroversial amongst many people  There many people support sides arguement devoted side story  I  however  feel censorship enforced law extent  One reason I believe way movie  magazine  book  etc  minor  wanting see read  parent child would able enforce see fit  There many parents nt see issue child watching rated movie playing rated game  government feels nt appropriate  child get parent concent able access things  I feel parents know want nt want children access monitor see fit  Another reason I dont feel censorship right child going find things anyways likely find way around system set keep  There reason shelter kids past certain age  old enough things available  dont find appropriate nt like aviod things without told  Most kids generation know things government might find inappropriate  due internt  offers ways around system  even knowing things nt much change society  My final reason dont feel right shelter children likely things access things kept  There many people say game   CAPS appropriate game teaches violent tendancies  true  I actualy feel keep kids things build hostility play kind games feel alright things parents taught happens games movies way deal things  I feel need censor media extent  There needs limit able censor age put censors  There reason block kids ot things already know things found way see things classified inappropriate

5843,2,Some people agree that we should takes books of the shelf that some people find offensive. I don't think that we should take things off the shelf that some people find offensive. Some people find about everything offensive. The reason why there is very boring stories on the is because some people just find every thing offensive. So most of the stories end up being about a boy that doesn't like owls or something stupid like that. Some people just find too many thing offensive. And they wonder why all of our scores are low it's because all of our stories are about little jonny's best day ever. Besides then all of the library shelfs would start going empty. Every time you would go to the library there would be more and more books gone. There would be a black lady at the desk yelling at the librarian about how there isn't enough books with black people in them. Or a asian person in that same postion asking why little in this story loved math and brang his caculator where ever he went. Some people are just too picky about things being racist. And it would restrict people's education. If things were being taken off library shelfs all the time some of the interesting stories would be gone. That means kids won't find as many stories that they like. And that means that not as many kids will like to read. And then that leads to kids grades going down. So it is best to just keep all of the books on the shelfs. There is just too many picky people out there wining about how every thing is racist or it just offends them. If we started removing all the things that people thought were racist or people thought was offensive we would have nothing left. And we want more kids to be interested in reading.

5845,2,"Most parents don't want the children of today's society reading or hearing of books about: drugs, alcohol, sex, skipping class, bullying others, or just doing things that most people know are inappropriate. In the libraries there are a wide variety of books containing these things on the shelves. Therefore, are all of these books elligible for an elementary or middle school kid to be reading or should the books be censored? Students of all ages have different reading abilities. Therefore, each individual will be reading something higher or lower based on what the student is able to do. But, does this account for the cruel use of inappropriate language and vulgarity. Students who read at the higher levels will eventually be taught more, this puts our society more at risk than what it already is. In today's society many people look at the 'cool' sitcoms and televisions shows as a way of how that individual should be living his or her Unfortunately, the media, including music, and reading materials are sending the people a wrong message. For example, The of a higher level reading book, sends off a message that racism isn't going to change. It has. Racism has changed dramatically over recent decades because of many commonly known people that lost their lives because of their skin color. Furthermore, the magazine that are being thrown around in today's libraries or nonetheless people's homes. The magazines could offer the student whom is looking at it that he or she isn't good enough. The reason for this is models. Models all over the world are anorexic, bulemic, or binging and purging in order to keep the 'perfect figure.' the innocent students looking at the magazine sit and question themselves, wishing they could look as beautiful as the model on the front page. Nobody in the world is perfect, therefore society needs to stop looking at the models in the magazines or reading about drugs just to fit in. as the years go on the society tends to get worse, so the people and the students need to make a stop to change that.

Its children under the sumption of years and younger that go in libraries to get a books and etc., to read and shouldnt have to go across things of that nature just to get what they want to read. If the books are goin to be on the shelves they should make a section for only adults that want to read those types of books and etc. In the library you should have to show a I.D in order to check out things of that source. It wouldnt be fair to take away things for adults that they might want to read or look at because they are grown which means they can do what they want. It should be a cut off point for kids when they go in the library. The children ages 1-@NUM1 should have their on section. The chidren should have their on section.

It is surprising some of the things that you can find in your local public library, and school libraries. So should the censorship be more strict? I believe that the censorship in libraries has become way too leaniant, and would benefit from becoming more strict on their policies. Durring the beginning of my tenth grade year in high school, I checked a book out from the school library. I was so astounded by the vulgarity of the book and was shocked that it ever even made it into the school. I took the book home and had my father glance through it and he too was disgusted by the filth of the material. In an effort to have the book removed from the school library, we contacted the principal and the librarians. They gave us a paper saying that we would have to read the entire book and find all the places that we believed were inappropriate. Some of the things that we read in the book, a student could get suspended for simpley talking about. The use of foul language and inappropriate behavior were found throughout the book, and the book was not condeming it, rather it was saying it was alright! After reading the entire book and finding about four pages of citations where things were offincive, we gave the book and the notes to the librarian. About a month later we recieved a letter in the mail saying that the board of librians had 'glanced' at the book and the information we had written down, and said that it was taken out of context. I'm not convinced that they knew we had taken it out of context if they didn't have to read the entire book themselves, but I am convinced that they made a mistake in not taking it off the shelf. So should materials like this be removed from libraries? I believe they should, because some of the things that you read, listen to, or look at in your youth can effect you for the rest of your life. I believe books like the one I previously mentioned are more common than we think and should be removed from shelves. I also think that music, movies, and magazines should have restrictions aswell. For example if they consist of profane lyrics or immodest photographs that they should be cautious about letting them in. Although I still believe that the censorship in libraries has become too leaniant, I also believe that people have the right to listen to, or read whatever they want; I just think that they should have to get it somewhere other than where it can fall into the hands of young adults or children who are easily influenced",8716,8717.0,Offensive Materials Libraries Katherine Paterson  author  made statement All us think book hope none children children taken shelf  But I right remove book shelf work abhor also exactly right everyone else  And books left shelf us   In saying right think one things seen libraries deffinately would nt want children pulling shelf read  It surprising things find local public library  school libraries  So censorship strict  I believe censorship libraries become way leaniant  would benefit becoming strict policies  Durring beginning tenth grade year high school  I checked book school library  I astounded vulgarity book shocked ever even made school  I took book home father glance disgusted filth material  In effort book removed school library  contacted principal librarians  They gave us paper saying would read entire book find places believed inappropriate  Some things read book  student could get suspended simpley talking  The use foul language inappropriate behavior found throughout book  book condeming  rather saying alright  After reading entire book finding four pages citations things offincive  gave book notes librarian  About month later recieved letter mail saying board librians glanced  book information written  said taken context  I m convinced knew taken context nt read entire book  I convinced made mistake taking shelf  So materials like removed libraries  I believe  things read  listen  look youth effect rest life  I believe books like one I previously mentioned common think removed shelves  I also think music  movies  magazines restrictions aswell  For example consist profane lyrics immodest photographs cautious letting  Although I still believe censorship libraries become leaniant  I also believe people right listen  read whatever want  I think get somewhere fall hands young adults children easily influenced
5848,2,"My grandfather was a very down to earth type of man. While he did provide a sturdy father figure for his children, he was also known to be rough, and quite strict at times. He kept a stong meal policy of, 'if you dont like it, dont eat it, but don't complain, and don't expect the meal to change ' I have heard stories from aunts and uncles of, if you didnt like what was being served for dinner, you simply weren't forced to eat it, but good luck finding dinner on your own, because there was no special treatment. In my mind, the same type of philosophy can be applied to censorship of media materials today. Censorship has existed for a very long time in the mainstream of whatever is popular in a time. For centuries, the kept an official list of '@CAPS1 Books.' On this list were books deemed so radical, evil, or corrupting that no one should be allowed to read them. However, it seemed this list had quite an opposite effect. The list was eventually discontinued because it came to the point that people were searching for reading material by perusing the list for books. This is because a list of banned books simply stirred up the public's curiosity of what was so bad in the books that they had to be banned. Returning to grandpa's theory, I feel that, pertaining to censorship today, if you don't like something, be it music, books, movies, or magazines, if you don't like it, simply dont read it, or watch it, or listen to it. But don't go trying to take it off everyone elses plates because you think it's so rotten. Let people form opinions for themselves. If a work is so terrible as one says, I trust that people will realize it while reading, and simply stop reading, or watching, or listening. However, a forced ban of something will just create more attention for the object, pulling peoples curiosity to it, as was experienced with the list of books. It creates an effect opposite the one desired. Lastly, it seems that ones attention should be drawn to what is actually being put onto these lists of banned materials. It has been a trend that books that have once been banned, end up as classics, such as the book The in the which for a long time was banned for reading in schools. Another example is the series of books. These wonderful children's books were banned because of the scenes of witchcraft and magic they portrayed. Parents decided that themes such as those could send the wrong messages to their children. This just seems like a tragic case of over protective parenting to me. All in all, censorship in the media today seems silly and redundant to me. It reeks of over protectiveness, and in most cases, accomplishes the task directly opposite the one intended. So for this matter, I say we stick with the tried and true philosophy of my grandfather, 'if you don't like it, dont eat it, but don't complain, and don't expect the meal to change.'",8718,8719.0,My grandfather earth type man  While provide sturdy father figure children  also known rough  quite strict times  He kept stong meal policy  if dont like  dont eat  nt complain  nt expect meal change  I heard stories aunts uncles  didnt like served dinner  simply nt forced eat  good luck finding dinner  special treatment  In mind  type philosophy applied censorship media materials today  Censorship existed long time mainstream whatever popular time  For centuries  kept official list   CAPS Books   On list books deemed radical  evil  corrupting one allowed read  However  seemed list quite opposite effect  The list eventually discontinued came point people searching reading material perusing list books  This list banned books simply stirred public s curiosity bad books banned  Returning grandpa s theory  I feel  pertaining censorship today  nt like something  music  books  movies  magazines  nt like  simply dont read  watch  listen  But nt go trying take everyone elses plates think s rotten  Let people form opinions  If work terrible one says  I trust people realize reading  simply stop reading  watching  listening  However  forced ban something create attention object  pulling peoples curiosity  experienced list books  It creates effect opposite one desired  Lastly  seems ones attention drawn actually put onto lists banned materials  It trend books banned  end classics  book The long time banned reading schools  Another example series books  These wonderful children s books banned scenes witchcraft magic portrayed  Parents decided themes could send wrong messages children  This seems like tragic case protective parenting  All  censorship media today seems silly redundant  It reeks protectiveness  cases  accomplishes task directly opposite one intended  So matter  I say stick tried true philosophy grandfather  if nt like  dont eat  nt complain  nt expect meal change  
5849,2,My oppion is that if it has alot of cursing and sexual things in it. We should take them off the shelfs because; if we can get to those books then that means that the children can get to them. Children are getting younger and younger haveing sex and cursing. If they can get to those books then they are going to want to have sex or curse sooner then they are in this generation. Some magizines in stores and in libraries show you all of this preety things and these models. Alot of the childrens even adults want to be just like this models and singers that we watch on music videos. They try to be like them but then they cant and it hurts their self-esteem and how people might think about them. My oppion is if we would get reed of this magazines then there would be more happier people in this world because; they wont be wishing that they are just like him or her. I set and watch tennagers around my age that are trying to become one of those people in the music videos. They keep on trying to get to their goal they do not care if it is hurting them inside or on the out side.

Then that book will be put on a list of what kids cant read. Now your probally thinking that kids are just gonna grab that book and sit down and read. Instead of checking it out. They could read it anyway. Well thats should be wrong. Our libraians should have adults patrolling the library and look at what books are being read.

5852,2,"Some materials are not meant to be seen by a young generation of viewers. It is important for libraries to set an age requirement for some of the graphic material the library have to offer. Some videos and written works contain pieces that might not be appropriate for children and even some teens. Parents allow their children to view such things at home, but in a public place, such as a library, children shouldn't be able to check out select material. These movies and books use adult language, violence, and contain nudity. Adult language is already a big enough problem among children. There are elementary school children who get in trouble for swearing at other students. On a more serious level, some children even begin to swear at authority figures. Allowing these children to watch films with an excessive amount of cussing would only condone those behaviors. Censoring what is available to young kids in a library could really help with the situation, especially if they pick up swearing from watching adult rated movies, rather than parents or siblings at home. As for the raising issue in violence, controlling what is watched by children can greatly impact the problem with violent behaviors. Many parents have taken a stand against allowing their kids to watch rated '@CAPS1' movies. It is time for libraries to help and be sure that the children cannot check out movies that are rated above their appropriate age level. People spend time rating movies for a reason; they want to inform adults what is and is not appropriate for children. Now is the time for libraries to do their part and help ensure that children do not watch inappropriate things. Lastly, and probably the most touchy subject, nudity. Over the years, media has added more and more nudity to their works. Many adults are entertained by this, but is it really appropriate for children to see? The answer is no. Nudity is something that should be discussed with children and parents, because not all people are built with the same anatomy. Before kids are sent into the world, they should have an understanding of the body, and not have to rely on outside media to tell them about it. With censorship on what type of literature and video can be checked out by people of certain ages, that outside media factor can be eliminated. Things like nudity, violence, and coarse language should be discussed in a comfortable, home setting, when the child is ready to talk about it. Parents need to step up and talk about these things with their kids, so that the kids can begin to see things through a more mature set of eyes. Libraries also need to do their part and make sure that parents have the opportunity to talk to their kids, rather than allow some movie, book, or magazine do the talking for them. Children could then get the wrong views and think what they are reading and watching are okay, which is not acceptable. There should be no problem from anyone, besides maybe the children who have already exposed themselves to the adult media, with some censorship rules within public libraries",8726,8727.0,Some materials meant seen young generation viewers  It important libraries set age requirement graphic material library offer  Some videos written works contain pieces might appropriate children even teens  Parents allow children view things home  public place  library  children nt able check select material  These movies books use adult language  violence  contain nudity  Adult language already big enough problem among children  There elementary school children get trouble swearing students  On serious level  children even begin swear authority figures  Allowing children watch films excessive amount cussing would condone behaviors  Censoring available young kids library could really help situation  especially pick swearing watching adult rated movies  rather parents siblings home  As raising issue violence  controlling watched children greatly impact problem violent behaviors  Many parents taken stand allowing kids watch rated   CAPS  movies  It time libraries help sure children check movies rated appropriate age level  People spend time rating movies reason  want inform adults appropriate children  Now time libraries part help ensure children watch inappropriate things  Lastly  probably touchy subject  nudity  Over years  media added nudity works  Many adults entertained  really appropriate children see  The answer  Nudity something discussed children parents  people built anatomy  Before kids sent world  understanding body  rely outside media tell  With censorship type literature video checked people certain ages  outside media factor eliminated  Things like nudity  violence  coarse language discussed comfortable  home setting  child ready talk  Parents need step talk things kids  kids begin see things mature set eyes  Libraries also need part make sure parents opportunity talk kids  rather allow movie  book  magazine talking  Children could get wrong views think reading watching okay  acceptable  There problem anyone  besides maybe children already exposed adult media  censorship rules within public libraries
5853,2,"Libraries consist of many different types of books. A lot of libraries, or all, allow you to check out any book you would like to check out. The only problem with that is not all books are appropriate for children. Not only are a lot of books inappropriate for children, but a lot of music, movies, magazines, and television shows are inappropriate for them too. Therefore I believe that a lot of material, such as books, should have censorship. Not all books are inappropriate, but the books that are appropriate can not be distinguished from the books that are inappropriate. I know this from my own personal experiences. As I was walking in the public library looking for a book, I noticed a very colorful book. I read the back of the book and thought it was interesting, so I decided to check the book out. When I reached my house I went straight to my room to read the book. Before I actually read the book I scammed through it; i noticed the book had alot of provanty in it. If the book was censored I would have never taken it home. Writting an inappropriate book, or making an inappropriate movie is not wrong at all, but the readers should be informed it is inappropriate. Most movies are do inform the audience of its status, but not all television shows. Before most inappropriate television shows there is an warning sign of graphic behaver. Unfortunately not all shows have the warning sign that is needed to allow a viewer to know wether or not there child, or them, is at the appropriate age to watch it. Music and magazines are not the same as books and movies. Most magazines, if any, do not have a label or warning sign on it. In order to know if there are graphic things in a magazine, you would have to read it your self. You are suppose to purchase a magazine before you read it, same with a You are not allowed to listen to a or read a magazine before you buy it. Therefore you are unaware if the magazine or is inappropriate. Children should not be exposed to rated things before they are A child learns a lot of things from what they hear and see. Librarians should censor the books if there is inappropriate things in there.

5854,2,"Many people think libraries are for nerds, geeks and people that have no friends. Other people think its a place where alot of great information can be found, and I am one of those people. People can find all these great books in the library. Books that are for children like jack and the bean stalk, there are books that are for teenagers, for example the left behind series is a book that alot of teens are reading. Then there are books. That probably includes books like steven king. But should all books and other materials be aloud in the library? There are books that are great for all readers and then there are books that only adults SHOULD be aloud to read. There are some librarys that have dirty books in there selection of books. Most librarys do have a sign that says the section but it doesnt stop teenagers and other kids from going in there and seeing all of that. Yes if they get caught they could be kicked out of the library for a period of time but the damage that the kid already say that is done. It is a convenence that there are music, movies and magazines you can check out and use. The good thing about the music and the movies is that kids and teens cant check out and watch or listen to the materials. So there is a benifit to that, but there is also magazines. There isnt much difference between magazines and books. The only thing is that magazines are worse. How are they worse you might ask? They be smaller but unlike books magazines contain pictures. And the same thing aplies with the books. Only adults SHOULD read the magazines cause the pictures not be very appropria, and after the kid or teen see's that the damage is already done. So my point is that I dont think that they should take out anything out of the library. I just think that the people at the library should have a gate that you have a card or password that only adults can have to be able to get into that certain area.

5855,2,"I Censorship in Libraries do you this? Do you have children? Well even though I do not I think that censorship in libraries isn't the right thing to do. Children need to be expossed to everything in life. That is I see this prediciment. I don't think that other people have a right to shelter our children from the stuff that's out there. They will eventually see this material. If it was me I would want my children expossed to this supstance of stuff, while in a controlled enviroment. Where if they were to have questions I or another adult I trust can answer the question properally. I think that children should be exposed to this material in books, movies, and music without being censored. Cernsoring out stuff isn't going to help your child out. If you as a parent don't expose them to it now, they will find it out later and not be correct. I know there are songs with cuss words and they talk sex all the time. But wouldn't you want to be with your child, or have someone you trust to be there when the child has a question the song, book, or even movie. I strongly agree that the children should be exposed to the materal before other children tell them wrong. Honestly I think that censoring stuff for children will make them curious, so they go out and find stuff out on there own. Now as the parent I believe you are, would you want them to learn the truth, from you or a book; or would you want them to find it out from some other child who has no idea what he's talking and give them a completely wrong impression.I didn't think you would. Because that could really mess up your child. When I was little, people would hide things from me. I felt sheltered and frustraded becuase no one would ever tell me. Being a child (already confused enough) not knowing why you couldn't listen to this song, or read a certain book; really took an impact on that childs life. I know from my experiences that not being allowed to do something really made me want to go out and accomplish it more. So as a parent tell your child stuff early so they wont have to censor libraries, block out songs, or not be allowed to show movies. Being in school is already frustrating. Not to mention going to the library and they tell you, you can't have this book because they're not allowed to carry it in school. Or when you get those free times to actually watch a movie and then the teacher comes back and tells you that the school wont allow us to watch it. It would get to you wouldn't it? Well it gets to a lot of people here at my school. So as I conclude my essay, I ask you again. do you this? I know they're are people out there that say well it's against my religion. Well what I would tell them is to not read it, don't watch it. I know it sounds wrong to say those things, but isn't that the truth? We have to be real with one another, take a stand.

5858,2,"Books are like people. No two are exactly the same. Some are exciting and crazy, others are more laid back. There are all different kinds of books because there are all different kinds of people. Toddlers and young children like picture books because they are bright, colorful, and easy to read. Children slightly older than them enjoy the more adventuresome short novels. Middle school and high schoolers tend to enjoy the longer, more involved novels about various interests. Adults enjoy many different forms of writing depending on their interests and personalities. Everyone entitled to their own opinion. Especially when it comes to books. A story that one person percieve as interesting, another find completely offensive. Therefore, in my opinion, all books should be left on the shelves in libraries. Some people might argue with this opinion by saying '@CAPS1 if a small child that didn't know any better picked up a book that wasn't appropriate for them?' In which case, I would respond, '@CAPS2 are this child's should be responsible for their children. If they suspect a book that their child wants to read not appropriate, they could read it first, or ask a librarian about their concerns. It's not right to deprive another person who would enjoy the book of the chance of reading it. I understand the concerns about stumbling upon a book that one find vulgar and offensive. However, there are solutions to that problem other than completely eliminating the book from the shelves. They could come up with a rating system, as they do for movies, that would set an age suggestment, and put reasoning for the rating. This would help people steer clear of books that they would find offensive. Only providing books that appeal to a select moral standard not fair to those who hold different moral standards. No one in this world should be deprived the leisure of reading because they find books uninteresting. Some people have different taste in books, and they should be allowed to read they want. In we claim to be 'free.' it really 'free' if our government controlling we can and cannot read?

5859,2,"People always complain, no matter what or who it is about. We always have to find something to complain about. Whether it has to do with our own morals or for our children, people will always try to change information to their liking. Censorship is one of the major examples. With all of the history that is behind books and other writings, censorship needs to remain isolated for the better of literature. Censoring words that are considered 'vulgar' to the population is like changing the entire book itself. The dialogue, and the emotion that is felt in between characters needs to contain the original wording in order for the author to be able to fully express how the tension would have felt in the story. The words are put there for a reason. Just like every other word in the book. They fit together like a puzzle. you have a puzzle with missing pieces, you do not fill the rest of the spaces in with pieces from another puzzle. It would not look right, and the picture would definitely look obscurred. The same thing applies to censoring a literature piece. Taking away or replacing anything in a novel would never turn out to be the same thing, no matter how bad one would want it to. There are no exceptions to this. It is ridiculous that anyone would even think about doing such a thing just because it is 'against their morals.' it comes to our children, they must be introduced to this kind of information, as well as everything else in the world. It is harmful to your child if he is sheltered. It is why they go to school, they must learn it on their own. It makes them who they are for the rest of their life. Your children will not get as much as read as they would with real words, real conversation, real emotion! People will always complain. It will never stop. In essence, it all dies down to being mature. We need to grow up and accept that fact that isolating censorship is vital. It can not be upheld.

5860,2,"Books in the library should not be censored, because many people have different views of what should be censored,and people should let the kids decide on what is offensive to them. There are many different people in the world and they all have different views on what should be censored. Everybody wants the best for their kids but other people can't tell other adults what their kids shouldn't be reading. Adults will start fighting with each other and some might not let their kids be friends anymore because they have different views on censorship for the books they read. We should not censor books because it could tear away friends that the kids have had for a very long time. We should let the kids decide what should be censored and what shouldn't, because the parents most likely will not read the book the kids have they will just ask questions about it. Let the kids decide because most of the kids parents have taught them good morals and values to base what they are reading in the library. Kids like to read biographies on peoples lives during wars and other hardships and i believe those would be the first to go. Kids need to start making choices for themselves and stop asking their parents what is bad and good.

5861,2,"Dear A few days ago, I walked into my local library looking to check out an interesting book and movie. When I took the book off the shelf, a magazine fell off, and into my hands. This magazine was a uncensored, type of magazine, as soon as I relized what it was I got up and threw it away. I am very angered by this incident, so I'm writing to you to help this problem before it gets out of hand. I've come up with a few ideas how to keep the libraries a more family friendly place. For starters, libraries can keep those nasty books, magazines, music and movies. Only if they removed them from the normal books, music, and movies, and put them into a certain area or corner for adults only, so children and adults not wanting to see them, don't. Second, they could make sure that the dirty magazines and dirty books at that the library, are only the dirty magizines and dirty books there. You don't want a person accidentally putting one in a book and returning it with the book, and a young child seeing the magizine. Third, they sould make sure that the people who look at and read the dirty novels dont read them out side of that corner or area in the library. A child could come up behind them and start looking and reading behind thier back. Thank you for reading, please take what I've said, and make people aware of the growing problem in our libraries. I want to make our libraries a safe place for children to read and learn once again",8744,8745.0,Dear A days ago  I walked local library looking check interesting book movie  When I took book shelf  magazine fell  hands  This magazine uncensored  type magazine  soon I relized I got threw away  I angered incident  I m writing help problem gets hand  I ve come ideas keep libraries family friendly place  For starters  libraries keep nasty books  magazines  music movies  Only removed normal books  music  movies  put certain area corner adults  children adults wanting see  nt  Second  could make sure dirty magazines dirty books library  dirty magizines dirty books  You nt want person accidentally putting one book returning book  young child seeing magizine  Third  sould make sure people look read dirty novels dont read side corner area library  A child could come behind start looking reading behind thier back  Thank reading  please take I ve said  make people aware growing problem libraries  I want make libraries safe place children read learn

I remember when I had a class project and i couldn't find all the information I needed I thought I was gone lose it, but my teacher told me to 'be resorcefull if you can find it in the book check look in a magazine,' and thats just what I did, and i found all what I was looking for. Having so many thing to pick from is worth living for. It you were to take all them materials off the shelves alot of th kids wouldn't be able to suceed cause they wouldn't be able to be resourceful. Alot kids learn alot just from reading one book. You get a better understanding just from looking at a movie, and it keep you up to date just from reading a magazins.

5863,2,"Censorship in libraries is not a valid idea. Controlling what people in a community can and cannot read is against what our country was established for. The books that clash with the opinion of the majority of people often are the ones that are remembered for the longest. Books like the ones that have been banned are important to help communities move forward from old ideas to new ones. Libraries should not censor the books that be offensive to reader's ideas. First, Libraries are a common way for children to learn to respect the opinions of other people. Children need to be able to understand that people will have ideas that clash with their own. Reading books that go against what you believe is a great way to learn how to cope with the people who have a different way of percieving the world. Children who learn to respect other's opinions will work better with other's and be agreeable with what other's have to say. Second, Reading potentially offensive materials can introduce ideas to a person that can sway the person's view point on many subjects. The people who wrote the offensive books were revolutionary for their time, and were criticized for their opinions. Now many ideas presented in the banned books are commonplace. Without books like these the way people think many never change. The ideas we use today many be different from years from now because of a book that is written during our lifetime. Third, Offensive material in libraries is there to express messages that have a deeper meaning than just what the text says. Books have been banned in the past because they stated arguments that go against what the average person believes. These books often hold messages that are still useful even in today's world. The messages have been offensive or dangerous in the past, but it is important to understand why they were offensive, and how the way the world is has changed to make the idea agreeable. Children are influenced by what they read, and the books that are best for them usually are the ones that show an opinion that clashes with their own. The people who wrote these books were revolutionary at their time, and now their ideas seem commonplace. Offensive materials have been banned before, but they have become more agreeable and still have arguments that can be related to the world today.

5864,2,I do not think they should be removed from the shelves. Everyone has their rights. Their is alot of things that people take offensive. So it would be point less to take them off the shelves. Theirs lots of music with words that can hurt one another. Their is books with bad pictures or words that can be harmful to people. Their is lots of things wrong with stuff. Taking stuff of the shelves would not help. Their is alot of facts in stuff that people would take a offensive. But you need those facts to achieve some of your goals. So thats a good reason why you can not do that. If they find something offensive than they shouldnt be looking at it or listening to it. If they dont like it than dont read it or watch or whatever your gonna do. I really think life could be harder if we didnt have some of the stuff that was offensive. You wouldnt be able to learn more because you would not have the source to learn the stuff. Their is lots of movies with offensive stuff that we all learn from. Their is also lots of magaziens that have bad pictures and bad wording. So it would not help if they took the stuff off the shelves.

5865,2,"Someone walks into a public library and opens a book. What do they see? They see a black marker over some of the words. Why would they see that? They see that because the is an offensive word or phrase in it, maybe even a picture. I do not believe that libraries should put marks in books, or even just remove them from the shelves. Libraries should not take down offensive materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. If the material offens someone, that person should just not use it. The library could just put a tag on it saying that it has offensive material in it. Everyone is different, some people like offensive stuff. Maybe they get entertained by it more than normal material. On the other hand, magazines that have nude pictures in it should be taken down. When I was in fourth grade I was in the library with a friend. We found this book about motorcycles and then checked it out.As we flipped through the book, we found a page that was colored black. I went up to the librarian and asked her why the page was colored over. She told me there was a bad picture in it. The only time a library should have the right to take down offensive books is in elementrary schools. I would not want my kid to be looking at bad pictures or words when they are so young. Public libraries have no right to take down the offensive materials though. Public libraries have differnet sections in themfor different people. The little kids don't go to the adult section. So that is where they should have the offensive materials. I believe the only time a library has the right to remove offensive materials is in an elementrary schools.

5866,2,"Removing books from the shelves is an idea that is not even worth taking into consideration. Not only would it completly dry out our supply of books, our librays would be ruined, and the knowlage we gain from said books would definatly decrease. Most if not all of our knowlage we have today came form books of the past and presant. If we were to remove books due to their content the world would become sheltered and innocent. The reality is that the world is not even close to being to be innocent and caing, we need these books to not only warn but to show how to aviod being in a very bad situation. The books on war help us see the horrors of destruction and clamity. With out these books the world would keep reapeting itself.

In conclusion no books should ever be banned or taken off the shelves. All books have a right to be there on the shelves. If you dont like a book then dont read it or even look at it.

5867,2,"Censorship is a standard to which books and other media are judged by. What should be considered when a library censores every book, magizine, music, movies and whatever they might also have in there collection of media. If you went to the library and found something that abhored your tastes, likes or believes you would want that removed so that you or your children would not have to see or read that content. But if there was somebody that wanted to have acess to that, then what? Somehow someone will have to decide if the media should be removed or stay in the library. Some libraries have given media ratings to help the usert know if they want to read, listen, or watch the media. This has helped create sections for adults and chilren; places where books and other media can be found to suit their interests. Libraries have an important job in a community where they lend media to the public. If a library censors their media the public will be better understand what they are checking out. Lets say there is media in a library that many people have complained about. Should the media be completly removed from the library? If most everybody agrees then, the media will be removed, right? What if there is someone that still wants that media? Will the majority win and the media will be removed; if that is what satisfies the most of the public then i agree. If the media is both wanted and not wanted equally then i suppose there should be a section in the library where that media is stored for the people who want to use that media.If some people find that content horrifing then there should be warnings giving a brief summary of what is included between the covers. because reading,watching or even listening to media could be damaging to the user. I hope that libraries can be a place where all people can come and check out whatever they want or need. After all is that not what libraries are for?To serve the people who use it.

5868,2,"Today there are thounds of books, movies, music,magazines, ect., that some how or some way offened people. Does this mean they should be taken off the shelves at libraries? Eventhough they be offensive to some people others really enjoy them. But there are reasons, why some of them should be taken off the shelves or at least only be alowed to be rented by adults like if they contain any profanity, sexual content, or vilance. Many kids today are using profanity like it is nothing. People try to put the blam on their parents but they are not all to blam here. Most of it is due to all the profanity in books, movies, music, magazines, and so on. All the content that is in these things are for adults not children and libaries should only let adults rent these and if thats a problem take them out all together. The public does not want to see a five year old using profanity. It is extremaly rude for a child to just say those things. An even bigger issue with some books, movies, music, and many more others, is it that they contain sexual content. Teens these days are going out and engaging in sexual intorcorse thinking that it is okay. It is not okay, but what is the cause for thir thinking? It is what they read, watch, and listen to. A magazine like is appealing to teen girls but what does it have so appealing in it. One thing that is in is sexual tips that are fun for teenage girls to read. Sexual tips should not be something a teenager should be reading for. They need to be out having fun, worring about school not what the best thing to do during intercourse. Additionaly alot of moies and music talk about sexual intorcourse like it is no big deal, it is cool to have sex as a teenager, everyone is doing it. Libraies should not allowe teenagers of anyone under eighteen rent things with sexual content in them. One other big issue is that there is vilance in these books, songs, and movies. Children are becoming vilent nowadays. They come to school with knifes and guns and think it is just fine no one cares. This is because they hear, see, and read about it, it is every where. Songs talk about killing people, and they make it sound like it is cool and the tue is catchy. Libraries need to take the things with vilance out or just limmit it to people over the age of eighteen to help reduce the issue of vilance in teenagers. Libraries need to take the books, movies, music, and many other things off the shelves, or only allow adults to rent them, that contain profanity, sexual content, and violence. Children are using profanity like it is their job. Teenagers are having sexual intercourse like there are no consecences. Lastly children are becoming way too violent.

5869,2,"In the words of author Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' From this quote we can see the issues of censorship in libraries. It is interesting that people see no wrong in doing such a thing, when this is a breach of everyone's rights of freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. Not to mention the consequences of such actions. A library should not have the power to revoke either of these freedoms, from anyone. If everyone has the freedom to say what they want, then they are just as free to write what they want, whether it be a story, magazine article, or script. What is created by the author is an idea that was intended to be shared with anyone who wished to listen, not only to be shared with those who would go through all the trouble of finding it. However, this all goes to waste if once they write their work it is removed from places of access, such as a library. They went through all of the effort developing their ideas and opinions or creating an original story, just for it to have been in vain. When their work gets removed, an author change their style or opinions in order to not have it taken out. In this way, the libraries' censhorship is effectively controlling how author's write. Just as it would be the right of the authors' to write their articles or what it is they have written, it is the readers' right to be capable of reading it. Who has given libraries the ability to decide what someone can or cannot read? No where is it said that they are allowed to restrict someone from reading what they had wanted to read. If it is, what would be the point in reading anyways? There would not be a point if one couldn't decide for one's self what was worthy of being read, simply because there was only one book to read, as it was the only one left on the shelf at the library. People draw their ideas from what they know and what they have read, and with only that one book available to be read, everyone's ideas would start to overlap. Creativity would effectively cease to exist, and it is all because the library decided to censor their selection. If a library were to remove something because it was believed to be offensive, that in itself isn't an excuse either, as they simply could have put a warning on that item. They are not capable of judging what is offensive for everyone, as every single person has unique views and interests. What one find as the most unoffensive statement ever, another find it is the single most offensive statement they have ever heard. The only solution would be to simply label the item in question as 'offensive to some,' as then if someone were to be offended by it, that they would have been warned beforehand, and it would have been their own decision to have read it. This way there could be no issue, and the item wouldn't have to be removed, so then it would be easily accessible to everyone who wished to access it. With this, the libraries censorship could be avoided. Censorship in libraries is a serious issue. It is not the choice of the libraries to decide what people are able to read by taking it off the shelf. Neither should the choice of what is author's are capable of writing about be up to the library by taking it off of the shelf.

The accidents envoling a child repeating what the book says, dangers of a child reading the book, how it be offensive and, the arguments of the law making it illegal and finally, why it should just not be aloud. First, is what should be thought of is the accidental possibility of a child repeating what the book says . Makes you think of all the wrong things it sends to the child.The actions or words being repeated from the book. It would be embarrsing or scary to no your child is saying things they have no business saying. How it could cause promblems for you and the child. Second, what if the child happens to read the book. What about the things that can go wrong. The child telling another child the word. Than that child telling another child or worse maybe the parent is talking to the child. The child happens to tell the parent the word and that could have a bad impact. Third, it maybe really offensive to someone the child talks to and uses the word. That could set things off and make trouble. Not to mention the feelings it affect. The word could have a meaning to it that could hurt others feelings. People take the word for a threat and which promblems start. In conclusion, is sometimes we dont think about the effects words and cencorship has on people.

5872,2,"Last year I discovered a book in library titled, '@CAPS1 that it was worth a decent amount of points and seemed easy enough to read, I checked it out. That evening I went to grandparents house and younger cousin, who is three grade levels younger than me, was at their house too. She was interested in book, for it being worth multiple points and definitely being an easy a few days, I had finished the book and had hung on to every word of it. I loved reading about the life of this teenage girl, because I was only a year or two younger than her. Reading about her lifestyle gave me an insight on some things to look forward to and some things to avoid. Little did I though, reading that book was going to put me in an awkward situation. cousin came up to me at school and asked me to show her where in the library it was located so she could check it out and get some easy points. Thoughts crossed mind of some of the situations the character in that book had been in, and I decided at that point that I did not feel comfortable letting younger cousin read about such situations. I quickly told her that friend currently had the book checked out. I did not want to be the person to allow cousin to learn about experiences and events that happened in this certain teenage girl's life. I felt cousin was too young and innocent to be reading about sex, drugs, and alcohol. Library books should be more closely monitored, rather than making every book availible to any student who so chooses to check one out. Not everyone in the world can be easily pleased. Books, nonfiction or fiction, can both be offensive to two different people in more than one way, as can movies, magazines, music, etc. For example, books can be offensive when it comes to religion, age appropriate content, and/or personal opinions. As another example, certain styles of music use vulgar words and descriptions that could easily offend the average person. Does this mean the books should be taken off the shelf or the music should not be listened to? Not necessarily, but there are ways that problems like this could be eliminated. Public libraries could start using an organization system which could divide books by their content. For example, romances in one section, teenage life in another, and so on. I realize that libraries are currently divided into children, fiction, and nonfiction sections, but it could be done much more in-depth to try and aviod offending the public. Movies already are divided by ratings, critic reviews, and age groups. There is no excuse about disagreeing with the content of a movie recently watched because the rating was availible to be viewed beforehand. No one would not have to step foot into a theatre or sit down before a if he/she had read the ratings and disagreed with the content. I think the system of rating movies is much more clear to the average person than the rating of a book or music. Never, though, should a book that has gone through all the processes to be published and placed in libraries, should it be taken off the shelf. Nor should music be taken off the shelves of music stores because of peoples' opinions. Every single person has different opinions and te right to do things differently, including choosing reading and listening sources. Why deprive someone of the kind of book they enjoy reading because another person disagreed with the contents portrayed? Once again, a better system of organization of books, music, movies, and/or magazines could be brought about to avoid bad happenings. In clusion, I hope that ideas of stronger organization with be acted on and things will soon change. Life is not fair and not everyone can be pleased, therefore, society should make helpful advances in trying to protect everyone from something they do not want to hear, see, or read",8766,8767.0,Last year I discovered book library titled    CAPS worth decent amount points seemed easy enough read  I checked  That evening I went grandparents house younger cousin  three grade levels younger  house  She interested book  worth multiple points definitely easy days  I finished book hung every word  I loved reading life teenage girl  I year two younger  Reading lifestyle gave insight things look forward things avoid  Little I though  reading book going put awkward situation  cousin came school asked show library located could check get easy points  Thoughts crossed mind situations character book  I decided point I feel comfortable letting younger cousin read situations  I quickly told friend currently book checked  I want person allow cousin learn experiences events happened certain teenage girl s life  I felt cousin young innocent reading sex  drugs  alcohol  Library books closely monitored  rather making every book availible student chooses check one  Not everyone world easily pleased  Books  nonfiction fiction  offensive two different people one way  movies  magazines  music  etc  For example  books offensive comes religion  age appropriate content  andor personal opinions  As another example  certain styles music use vulgar words descriptions could easily offend average person  Does mean books taken shelf music listened  Not necessarily  ways problems like could eliminated  Public libraries could start using organization system could divide books content  For example  romances one section  teenage life another   I realize libraries currently divided children  fiction  nonfiction sections  could done much indepth try aviod offending public  Movies already divided ratings  critic reviews  age groups  There excuse disagreeing content movie recently watched rating availible viewed beforehand  No one would step foot theatre sit heshe read ratings disagreed content  I think system rating movies much clear average person rating book music  Never  though  book gone processes published placed libraries  taken shelf  Nor music taken shelves music stores peoples  opinions  Every single person different opinions te right things differently  including choosing reading listening sources  Why deprive someone kind book enjoy reading another person disagreed contents portrayed  Once  better system organization books  music  movies  andor magazines could brought avoid bad happenings  In clusion  I hope ideas stronger organization acted things soon change  Life fair everyone pleased  therefore  society make helpful advances trying protect everyone something want hear  see  read
5873,2,"I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found offensive, even if you would not want other people, such as children, to read that material. If everyone could just take a book off the self if they found it offensive, like Katherine paterson said, there would be none left for any of us. Also taking away offensive material would leave people without something to wright or without a job. Having children read offensive materials should not be allowed but if we took books off that are offensive there woulf be none. Keeping children away from offensive books, magazines, music, movies, and many other things should be the parents responsability to do. Taking away all the offensive books, movies, magazines, music, and other thing would leave nothing for the rest of us. Having all these things gone would leave a very boring world. There would be no funny movies to laugh at, no books to cry at, and no music to dance to. Taking away all the offensive material would leave people who wright those thing without a job or anything to do. No one would be able to read their work or want it because someone finds it offensive. Taking books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials away because someone finds it offensive is not a right thing to do.

5874,2,"Views on Censorship I believe that certain books or other materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries. makes a great point in her quote when she says that there will be no books left on the shelves. Her point is to tell the people that the materials should stay on the shelves because other people like adults read them and some are not meant for children. If materials are being removed from the shelves because of this then there will not be any books left. Censorship should be allowed to protect children from topics they shouldn't refer to such as bad lanuage. If people leave every book or magazine on the shelves then anyone can use it because it is there wheather it is censored or not. I think cenorship helps many people from being exposed to various materials. Parents have the right to say if there children should look at some books or materials. For example, some children listen to music that has bad language on it and I think is bad for young children to listen to. As an alternative, I think parents should have there children listen to clean music so they aren't involved in that type of lanuage. I think it is a good idea for children to listen to clean music because if children listen to explicit music and start to get familiar with the words, they start to memorize them. Children can get in trouble at school for explicit language because it is a very bad thing to use that kind of language. Once kids start to use those types of words then they use them everyday. Some of the stuff on the shelves are found offensive because people don't realize the language or content that books music or other materials. When people start to hear language that is bad then parents wonder why their child is saying that and where they heard it from. If parents were more alert at what their children listen to or read, then they can have a better understanding of how they talk or anything else. I think Katherine Paterson said this quote because she wants to hear the readers voice on what should and shouldn't happen to cenorship and if it still is occuring then there will be no more books or materials left on the selves. Her voice towards the reader makes me understand why I believe about this topic",8770,8771.0,Views Censorship I believe certain books materials removed shelves libraries  makes great point quote says books left shelves  Her point tell people materials stay shelves people like adults read meant children  If materials removed shelves books left  Censorship allowed protect children topics nt refer bad lanuage  If people leave every book magazine shelves anyone use wheather censored  I think cenorship helps many people exposed various materials  Parents right say children look books materials  For example  children listen music bad language I think bad young children listen  As alternative  I think parents children listen clean music nt involved type lanuage  I think good idea children listen clean music children listen explicit music start get familiar words  start memorize  Children get trouble school explicit language bad thing use kind language  Once kids start use types words use everyday  Some stuff shelves found offensive people nt realize language content books music materials  When people start hear language bad parents wonder child saying heard  If parents alert children listen read  better understanding talk anything else  I think Katherine Paterson said quote wants hear readers voice nt happen cenorship still occuring books materials left selves  Her voice towards reader makes understand I believe topic

The reason i think this is because it could affend people and make them want to hurt people with words and even possible come to the concusion and might even killl someone because of what that person said to the person who finds that offensive. For instance say a white person called a black man a the black man would take that offensive and could possibly kill the white man or if the white man tells the black man that he is just playin around and then the black man wouldn't be so quick to jump, but if the black man doesn't care and the white man called him a then he would leap to the white man because of this. Other books that should be taken off are books that curse or have profanity in them. I think this because little kids shouldn't be reading that because when they get older they will start callin everyone bad names and just sayin names in general. Another reason these books should come off the shelf is because the could have bad picture and i'm pretty sure no parent wants there little kids looking at those kinds of pic because the children are so young and they dont need to know what that stuff is.

5880,2,"Do you wish to remove offensive books out of libraries? i dissagree with this. i think that we should keep them in our libraries but we should make it to where little kids can not get a hold of them. for example we could put them on shelves behinf the librarian's desk so you have to ask for permission to go back thier and get one. or have an age limit that you have to be to check out a book. If we had a way to keep these books out of our childrens hands when they go to the library we would not be in this situation. these librarians need to start doing something to remove these books out of our childrens view. They need to figure out a system or procedure they can do to get these books in a better area. they could divide the library in half and have a side for kids and a side for adults. Then anyone could go to the kids side and if you wanted to go to the adult area you would have to show them your license or i.d. for them to confirm your the right age limit for these novels. If our library's did this procedure then we would not have to worry about these problems with our kids getting into things they are not suppose to and preventing them to learn things they do not need to know. People dont think about our kid's getting into these kind of things but they do they do not know any better and they are curious about things so they get into them. Our society does not realize that our kid's are our future society. They are going to be the ones controlling our towns and our country and other important job's like that. When they get older they will be the ones in charge instead of us elders. They will make the rules for our country they will decide what happens to people if they do something wrong they will make the decicsions. So why would we let them read something that could corrupt thier brains and change thier life. this is why our librarys need to develop a procedure like this one. I am sure some librarys have already went through this and have made up a procedure, but now it is time for the rest of them to make a procedure up to. before this gets out of hand and changes another childs life. I dont want to see our childrens future go down the wrong roads. I know they will to if they are reading things they should not be reading thats why they put age limits on books and rate them. So children dont get into them, but our librarians do not do a good enough job keeping them away from our kids. if this keeps continueing i have a great feeling that our kid's will ruin thier lives. parents also play a big role in this to because if you let them read these articles then your doing something just as bad as the librarians. Plus not to mention that the kids will bring thier kids up the same way thier parents brought them up. so this is why i think that our kids should not be aloud to read certain material because it can really mess with thier brains and ruin thier lives and i do not want to have them making our future corrupt; so this is why I am writing this essay. i hope it helps people out for all of our childrens sake.",8782,8783.0,Do wish remove offensive books libraries  dissagree  think keep libraries make little kids get hold  example could put shelves behinf librarian s desk ask permission go back thier get one  age limit check book  If way keep books childrens hands go library would situation  librarians need start something remove books childrens view  They need figure system procedure get books better area  could divide library half side kids side adults  Then anyone could go kids side wanted go adult area would show license id  confirm right age limit novels  If library s procedure would worry problems kids getting things suppose preventing learn things need know  People dont think kid s getting kind things know better curious things get  Our society realize kid s future society  They going ones controlling towns country important job s like  When get older ones charge instead us elders  They make rules country decide happens people something wrong make decicsions  So would let read something could corrupt thier brains change thier life  librarys need develop procedure like one  I sure librarys already went made procedure  time rest make procedure  gets hand changes another childs life  I dont want see childrens future go wrong roads  I know reading things reading thats put age limits books rate  So children dont get  librarians good enough job keeping away kids  keeps continueing great feeling kid s ruin thier lives  parents also play big role let read articles something bad librarians  Plus mention kids bring thier kids way thier parents brought  think kids aloud read certain material really mess thier brains ruin thier lives want making future corrupt  I writing essay  hope helps people childrens sake 
5881,2,"Dear name is and I believe that the censorship in libraries is in great need for improvement. Personaly I do not believe that the books and magazines that are in the library should be compleatly removed, but something needs to be done to keep the children away from the things that are not appropriet for their young minds. Children, in this age, are exposed to much more than they should be; through the internet, magazine adds, television, music on the radio, and now even some books. Their are many ways for the censorship in libraries to be improved upon, including; keeping things that are consitered offensive away from children, keeping children's minds focused on alternative healthy activities for their age groups, and having an area for just adults, where the materials we do not want our children around can be kept. When you go to any public library you expect things to be family friendly, and that it will be a healthy environment to take your entire family into, including your children. An excellent way to keep children from even thinking of picking up something that they should not pick up, is to not give them the option. If children never see the book in the first place their is no way that they are going to want to look at it. Keeping adult books, magazines, television programs, and music out of childrens sight and mind involves much more than just putting the book up high on the top shelf, it also involves advertising. When libraries and book stores are trying to encourage you to pick up a copy of the latest book they received they do so by putting it on display, and advertising to their customers that they now have a new book, that is a great read for everyone. Children are very influential, especially the younger they are, and with that kind of advertising it would be very easy for them to want to read that book, just because their is a sign outside of the library which said it was a 'must read' or that it is 'great for people of all ages!' way to encourage the cencorship of public libraries is to keep childrens minds focused on better options. If the public library had a childrens area with games, toys, music, fun childrens books, and even story time it would be much more enjoyable for children to go to the library. Even if the parent of a child is interested in reading a book that they do not feel is appropriete for their child then they could go find the book elsewhere while their child is happily playing with all of the games, toys, and childrens reading options that have been given to them. I know from experience how difficult it can be to tell a child no. If a child see's a book on display that they try to pick up, it can be very difficult to tell and convince them to put the book back, but in a children's area that would not be a problem. Parents could take their children to the library and no longer have to worry about their child trying to pull every book off the shelf, and what is going to happen if they flip open a book to the wrong page and see some words that they should not be looking at. In addition to having a childrens area I believe that it would also be beneficiary to have an area just for adults. Their are obviously adults are are interested in the books that we are trying to keep from our children, or they would not have wrote them in the first place. I think that it is unfair to compleatly prevent people from reading what they want to just because we do not think it is appropriet for young children. People obviously want to read those books, look at those magazines, and watch those television programs and just beacause we do not see it as appropriet for little children does not mean that it is wrong for a grown adult to read a book if they chose to do so. There are many classic novels such as To A that would be seen as offensive in a public library just because of the language used in the novel. Personally, it would just not be right to keep all those classic novels, from everyone. If their was a part of the library, such as a separate room, or a coffee shop that held novels that were flagged as innapropriete or offensive to young children it would greatly benefit the library and the citizens who went their. Are you tired of always trying to keep your child from pulling a book off the shelf that you know if full of bad words? Their are many ways to keep certain materials away from children, aside from compleatly pulling them off the shelf.

5882,2,"I believe that the author that takes the time out of his busy day to write a book, should be able to put it into the library on the shelves without any problems. The steps an author has to take to even write a book to get paid because it is his job and to let the public know about his/her books. That is why they think of a library because that is where people go to learn about diffrent topics. The other reasons why I think that books of all nature should be on the shelves is, it is important to have them because you have alot of kids, adults, and others that wanna learn and maybe if they go to the library and look, it isn't there. That just creates more and more arguments and confusion on the authors part and the people of the community. The libraries wonder why they don't have alot of people coming because the people of that community are probably starting their own library of their own. They don't have to have certain books they can have variety. I also think that some stuff that is adult related material, should be in a restricted area where no kids can get to. That would solve all the library problems all around the country. This would make all the libraries more reliable when it comes to the censoring and learning.",8786,8787.0,I believe author takes time busy day write book  able put library shelves without problems  The steps author take even write book get paid job let public know hisher books  That think library people go learn diffrent topics  The reasons I think books nature shelves  important alot kids  adults  others wan na learn maybe go library look  nt  That creates arguments confusion authors part people community  The libraries wonder nt alot people coming people community probably starting library  They nt certain books variety  I also think stuff adult related material  restricted area kids get  That would solve library problems around country  This would make libraries reliable comes censoring learning 
5883,2,"When an author writes a book to his readers, he uses his thoughts and opionions. In our country, it's alright to voice your opionion. Books in libraries should not be censored or banned, because it's the writer's right to be able to say what they believe, or write what they want to write about. If you don't want to read what you think is offensive, don't pick that book. My teacher has told me stories about parents banning books because they don't think their child should read them. Books based on mythology and witchcraft, such as have been banned, because parents don't think it's suitable for their children. When you ban or censor books like that, you're not letting the child learn what they need to learn. Mythology is used everywhere. If children are never aloud to read or learn about it, what will they do in the real world, when so many things refer to mythology? They'll be lost. From what I've observed, people need to just accept other beliefs. You don't have to start believing in what other people believe in, but accept that other people have different beliefs. If you banned all the books that had violence, sex, drugs, and any other things your children 'shouldn't learn about,' you would be getting rid of alot of major literature. Any popular piece of literature would be banned, The all of the things we refer to everyday. If we didn't have these, there would be no books. When you don't like a book or a magazine, just don't read it. If your children want to read it, let them, because if you keep these things from them, they'll never know what's out there.

5884,2,"In my opinion i do believe that if any materials in a library are offensive, they should be removed. Would you want your children reading offensive and bad humor or language when they are at the library? I would most definatly remove offensive materials from libraries. I would move offensive materials from libraries because children do not need to be reading that. Libraries are a place of peace and knowlage. Libraries are where kids go to learn knew things and study, they shouldn't be reading offensive materials. I have always loved to go to the libray when i was a little girl, but if there are offensive materials in it, that children should not be reading, or watching, i strongly think that they should be removed. If they are not removed i would not want my children to go there and be seeing that kind of stuff. I most definatly think that at least some of the offensive materials should be removed. One of the reasons that i think offensive materials should be removed from the library is that children are very easily influenced by what they see, or read. I would not want my kid to be going off and saying or doing very offensive things to someone. It is not right to influence kids in bad ways, so the libraries offensive books, music, movies, magazines and anything else that is offensive in the library should most definatly be removed. If a material is offensive in a library maybe they should just put it somewhere else, like in a adults room or a storage room. The children should not be seeing that kind of material, so it should be put somewhere else. Children are very easily influenced. We should band the offensive materials from libraries because we do not want our children to be rotten and crude.

Even though it was just a movie that she saw her older brother watching. This is a major problem for our youth. Books should not be censored because the fact is if your old enough to read somthing that has unappropriate suggestions, or themes. Then you are old enough to put the book down. For instance, the book written by Has a word in it that slurs black people, but it is history and i think we should be able to read the original writing by As for music, libraries do not usually have compact discs for people to borrow. Movies are a fabulous way of learning, but not all movies a library carries are about learning. Some could be like the one brother rented, and could be harmful to some viewers.

Even if there were any, if you want to check out that specific stlye of reading by all meens do it. Overall, if you take items out of a library because they have nudity or obcene jestures. Your not going to have a library left. There should be an age limit on the items you can check based on the content of that item.

5887,2,"Books, magazines, movies, and etc. are things in life that give us information and let us express our ideas. If I were to have the right to remove a book, magazine, movies, and more; I do not think I would remove it from the shelf completely in a way. There are others ways to prevent children from recieving offensive material. They could be put in such areas, like behind the desk and whoever wants it would have to have a parents promition or you would have to be a certain age. The materials should not be removed from the shelves. Another senario to that could be placing the books behind the desk of the store, library, etc., and not in reach of children. They could be displayed but put out of reach of children. If someone would want that book, magazine, movie, etc., then they would need a parents promiton or be of age to be able to recieve that item. No one should have the complete right to remove an item that they think is offensive. There are other people in the world who might not think certain things are offensive, that others do. So to remove something should not be the answer to the problem, it should be to put them out of reach of the children and make it to where you have to be a certain age to recieve that book, magazine, or movie, etc. People do not have the same opinion on things, if it is that big of an issue to worry about what your child is going take off the shelf, then do not give them the right to choose. There would be no books left on the shelves in the world, if people have the right to remove books, magazines, movies, etc. Those are ways of information in this world and ways that people express there ideas. If you do not want your children to read or take a certain book, then do not allow them to.

5889,2,"To begin with, I think that we should take inappropriate books, music, movies, etc. off the shelf because, there are little kids that attend that library too and they shouldn't be exposed to any of those things. If they do keep those certain things around, they should have another section of the library for teenagers to adults so kids wouldn't get ahold of it. Another suggestion is, you can have another library that can only be for teenagers and up so that can decrease the rate for kids reading, looking, and hearing inappropriate things. Secondly, libraries are only there for certain purposes, to check out books, its a place you can do your homework at, and to research. You shouldn't be allowed to play games there, unless they are learning games, and you definitely shouldn't have movies there. Many teenagers don't go to the library to do those things, they go just to hang out. The library should be a place for learning and experiencing. I observed that many teens also do not go to the library anymore and that reason is because, it's no longer fun to them. Also, if you eliminate the inappropriate things, you should have something else fun and exciting for them to do such as, have learnig activities, reading sessions for the young readers, etc. You also should have tutoring sessions there. We don't want our kids to learn about or talk about something that they don't need to know at that age. If you open up another library just for teenagers and up, you would probably would increase in popularity and you don't have to worry about kids seeing, hearing, and reading certain materials. Therefore, inappropirate things should be taking off the shelf until you seperate the library into two sections or just make another library for older people. I think it'll be easier to just divide the library, because you don't have to do as much moving and adjusting as you would need to do if you just take it to another library. Censoring the libraries is the best option for the young readers. You should have security there to stop the kids from entering the adult section and book needs to have a age limit. To prevent kids into tricking you, you should aslo have different library cards. For example the young adults and adults should have a white card and the younger people should have a yellow card with their name and age on it. In conclusion, censoring the libraries is the best option. Kids today are already growing up too fast so it's gonna be your job to try to stop the young kids from learning about in your library. Another way to stop kids from getting ahold of ceratin materials is, you can put them in a case and have a lock on it and they'll need your permission to get it.

5890,2,"All books have a certain style and tone an author wants to portray. Even though a book be offensive to one person, another person find valuable information in the very same book. This quote holds true because all people can find something offensive if they read deep enough into a story. Books, magazines, movies, or music should not be taken off the shelf just because one person finds it offensive. It is understandable that parents want their children to grow up in an environment free of material that be offensive. However, parents can supervise their children in a library and keep them away from those particular sections. Young adults and teenagers see a different side to the story and enjoy a book that an elderly couple or parent completely disagrees with. All authors try to make books entertaining for readers. None the less, many times a book can be bias. Although this can be a problem to some readers, other readers enjoy it throughly. No author can please every reader's wants and needs. If every book pleased every person, our libraries would never have customers. Many people want something exciting to read even if it offends one or two people. It is always easy to find negatives in a book. However, try looking past the negatives and see why a different person might enjoy it. Society can sometimes be sensitive to racial, ethnic, gender, occupational, or weight topics. It is understandable that when your particular group is being 'thrown under the bus', one would get offended. Readers should try to look past that, and see the bigger picture. People can learn from every book, even the book another person in the community sees as offensive. As children are growing up, young adults are figuring themselves out, and wise people are living their lives. Books, magazines, movies, and music will always be used as entertainment. What one person sees as offensive, another see as a way to spend their What if a movie or book you love is taken off the shelf? What if your favorite magazine is forbidden at the library?

5891,2,"I've always absolutely loved libraries. Not only do they never fail to maintain such a peaceful and cozy atmosphere, but they also have such a wide variety of all different kinds of books, magazines, and other articles. Even though a wide variety seems as if it should be considered a good thing in libraries to everyone, there are quite a lot of people out there who would without a doubt disagree. Of course, there are going to be books that some people just flat out don't have any interest in what so ever, which obviously is perfectly fine. They can easily just walk right by them and going about their business, not particularly losing or gaining anything. However, there are several books and other articles that have been accused of being inappropriate or offensive for various different reasons. People who are offended by certain books certainly have a right to wish that they be banished from libraries. But if everyone was allowed to do that as they pleased, what would there be left to read? You could find an offensive or rude remark in just about any book if you searched hard enough. Take into consideration that the way you are interpreting it, could be completely different from the message the author was trying to distribute. In conclusion, I think the solution to an offensive statement you come along in any book is simple; return the book and walk away.

5892,2,"How would you feel if your child came home and started asking questions about racist, and/or gender slang words? You would want to know where they are learning these words. There are many books that have racist words, discrimination towards mainly females, but sometimes also towards males. Racism is not as big of a problem today as it was in the past, but it is still around. One book that I have read and have found a lot of censorship in is, 'The Of This book has been pulled out of many schools because some people took this book as offensive, due to the racial comments. I do not think the author was trying to make people feel like it was discrimination, but the way some of the book is worded I can see how they would feel the way that they do. the author of this book was using a lot of irony and satire in this book. He was not trying to discriminate against These types of books should be pulled off ALL shelves. No matter if the author is meaning for it to be racist or not. I think if there is any question on if someone would take it to offense then it should be fixed or just not get out on the shelf, because it saves the worry of someone making a big deal out of something you had no idea about. Some of the words used in the book ' The Of should be reworded. Personally I do not like to hear nor say the '@CAPS9' word. That word is used frequently throughout the book. I think that books like this should not be a required to read aloud in a class room. I do not read a lot of books, but I have heard people talk about many different books and there are many books out there that have censorship in them, sad to say. No wonder there is hardly any peace in the world! No one can get along. A lot of that has to do with racial comments, slang, etc. In schools there are fights all the time because of a racist comment, or gang related. Unfortunatly we have people out there who like to cause commotion so any time someone says one little thing wrong, and not knowing what they said was wrong or that was offensive, certain people will try to start a fight over it.

Should something be done about this or is it natural. See if a library is selling anything with curse words or bad pictures then i think they need to be sued.

5895,2,"People have many different opinions on what they think is offensive as far as what they read and what they listen to. I have a different opinion on books than I do on music and movies. I believe books should stay at libraries, and certain types of music shouldn't be in libraries. In libraries all around the books are put on shelves for the entertainment of all readers. Some books are good, some are bad. It depends on who is reading the book. Many times books are considered racist, or disrespectful to certain people. I don't believe that the book should be taken off the shelves. If people think a book is offensive, then don't get it, and let someone else worry about it. Although books are the main thing at libraries, they aren't the only thing. There are all types music, magazines, and movies that you can find. I personally enjoy the movies and music. I am also aware that some music and movies are offensive, and hurtful. If there is a major controversy over an album or band, I think the owner of the library should listen and see if it is acceptable. Some music can't be sold in libraries, so it is sold in a place like or Also some material can't be shown in a public library. I believe this because more music today use slag and inappropriate words. Still people get it because it sounds cool and is often easy to get. When people get books they often forget about them or misplace them. That is my biggest problem. I think that if I have music or a movie I will be able to watch it and remember it easier than if I read it. Also I just get bored when I read, and find something else to do. After reading though it sticks in my head. Again people have different opinions and think differently about books.

Well my frist reason on why you shouldn't remove this material are what well people do in there free time cause some of this people like to read a book by some time to time or read a magazine or a comic book. Cause this is what the teen look on the books they like they look for drama, action, adventure, street life, and etc.. but if you remove those knid of books no teen will understand a book or read on.like for me I read this book called In in that book called out for me why cause he had things that i under stood about them I new what there about honstly its was the first book I ever read in the thing goes for the magaines and comic books people. Without those thing nobody will like to go to a librarie. My second reason is why will you remove the comupters why let me tell why you shouldn't some people go to the libraries to use computers why to listen to musi, to look for movies, to talk to firends, and to do homework for school I mean people go to to libraries to relax to listen to music in the computers but mostly to do homework why cause maybe they don't got computers in there house in they have an assiment that there giving in school in one of the materials they need is to use a computer in if the libraries remove them were well they go. In the last reason is if they should find this offensive then just dont get the book they shouldn't just remove the book just cause one person find it offensive cause you never know someone will like the book in not find it offensive in get that book in also my become his/her favorite book so just don't remove a book or a computer just cause one person find it offensive cause that person should be smart just to get another book or go to different website in or just get out.

5897,2,There are millions of books around ther world in thousands of libraries. If there is a book that afends you then you should just put it down and look for a new one. Like Katherine Paterson stated if people started to take books that offended them off the shelf we would not have any books. There are going to be books out there that offend people but there going to have to find a way not to let it bother them. Because the truth of the matter is that every book thats in a library is there so we can learn from it. The books have a purpose and its not to offend people it is so we can greater our knowledge. For example if I am african american and I see a book about slavery. Should I let that offend me? NO I should not because the reason the books on the shelf is so we learn from our mistakes and never do a horrible thing like slavery again. Or what if I am jewish and I had a great grand mother that died in the camps. Should I let a book about the get to me? NO I should not because I should know that that people learned from that tragic event and are trying to teach everyone else about it. What if I was a tree hugger. I look up on the shelf to see a book about landfills and poulution. Should I be happy? Absolultly yes because when I see that book on the shelf I should know that its there to teach people about the dagers of littering and what it could do if we dont stop.

This book illistrates the harsh treatment between blacks and whites that went on, and still continues, in Censorship doesn't stop there, it goes on into movies, music, and magazinges. If people named every item out in this world they thought contained cruelty, vulger language, racial attacks, what kind of intertainment would we have? How would the public react? Would our repeat history? These books that are being censored are the ones that tell the truth, the real truth of what has gone on in our history. They don't candy coat it and give us the run around, they let it out. There are many books that are on censored lists, and why is that? If wasn't alowd to read the books that tells the truth, of what happened in the camps of in the racial fight of the if we are barred from reading this, how would we learn not to repeat history? I don't think books that tell of two opposing sides fighting over something that was very real in our past is completly for entertainment, but for education purposes too. When I read a book that tells of the fight between two apposing sides I'm usually persuaded towards one, and and in seeing this cruelty that actually happens in the world, I can see the true wrong that has gone on in our The world seems to try and sweep these things 'under the rug' so to say. In reading these examples in these books I see what I do not want to happen later in life. Censorship doesn't just stop at books. Wal censors music, and also video games. Yes, this censorship is a lot different from the censorship of books, but they are still restricting us from buying certain items from their shelves. Do I have the right to buy a that cuss's every other word? It's my money, and they are the ones that gets the benifit, so why can't I buy this there? There is a line between censorship and parenting though. What a parent does, and does not want their child to watch, listen to, or read is up to them. They are the parent of the that child, and do have resposibility for him/her. But because this movie is bad for little kids are we going to take it completely off of the shelves of every store? Children can't acess these items that easily. I don't know any young children that have the access to money to buy an rated movie by themselves. All in all, we have the choice.

5900,2,"They say in the medical world that exposure to germs early on can help build up the immune system and prevent a person from getting sick later in life. Does this state of mind apply to other issues in life as well? The answer is yes and censorship is one of them. When libraries censor their reading material, they are shielding people from the realities of the world. The reading material should not be censored because the bad elements of the world should not be hidden, everyone has the right to seek out what they desire to know and everyone is responsible for their own actions. First of all, there should not be censorship in libraries because the bad elements of the world should not be hidden. By censoring reading material the library is trying to spare feelings, cover up vulgarity and shield readers from injustice. Though this is done out of the best interest of the readers, it is not going to help them in the long run. Injustice and overcoming obstacles are inevitable parts of life, and by becoming exposed to them early on, citizens can be better prepared to take on the real life situations of the world. Next, everyone has the right to seek out what they desire to know. In truth, all people are equal and apart from the law, no one has authority over anyone else. Therefore, nobody has the power to tell another person what they can or cannot read. If someone wants to read offensive material, that is their personal choice. Everyone has the right to make their own decisions, so why should this not apply in libraries? In addition, everyone is responsible for their own actions. If someone is looking through a book that contains inappropriate or offensive content, it is up to them how they respond to it. Also, the author of a publication is responsible for the content of their work. Anything they write is credible to their name whether it be good or bad, and all authors are subject to criticism and responsible for any people they offend. Also, parents are responsible for teaching their children how to respond to foul material and not to go looking for it. In conclusion, libraries should not censor their reading material. By doing so, they are shielding people from the realities of the world. Libraries should not use censorship because the bad elements of the world should not be hidden, everyone has the right to seek out what they desire to know and everyone is responsible for their own actions. Just as exposure to germs can help build up the immune system to fight illness later in life, exposure to offensive material can help build up the tolerance system to help fight injustice and overcome the obstacles of the world.",8822,8823.0,They say medical world exposure germs early help build immune system prevent person getting sick later life  Does state mind apply issues life well  The answer yes censorship one  When libraries censor reading material  shielding people realities world  The reading material censored bad elements world hidden  everyone right seek desire know everyone responsible actions  First  censorship libraries bad elements world hidden  By censoring reading material library trying spare feelings  cover vulgarity shield readers injustice  Though done best interest readers  going help long run  Injustice overcoming obstacles inevitable parts life  becoming exposed early  citizens better prepared take real life situations world  Next  everyone right seek desire know  In truth  people equal apart law  one authority anyone else  Therefore  nobody power tell another person read  If someone wants read offensive material  personal choice  Everyone right make decisions  apply libraries  In addition  everyone responsible actions  If someone looking book contains inappropriate offensive content  respond  Also  author publication responsible content work  Anything write credible name whether good bad  authors subject criticism responsible people offend  Also  parents responsible teaching children respond foul material go looking  In conclusion  libraries censor reading material  By  shielding people realities world  Libraries use censorship bad elements world hidden  everyone right seek desire know everyone responsible actions  Just exposure germs help build immune system fight illness later life  exposure offensive material help build tolerance system help fight injustice overcome obstacles world 
5901,2,"How parents should react to the books kids read I believe that children should be aloud to read whatever they would like to read. It is hard enough to even get kids to read a book. Me on the other hand you could not get me to put a book down for more than a half an hour. Now children won't pick up a snall book even, or as some would call it a kiddie book. I belive parents have a right to say what their children read but don't punish other children for two or three parents not wanting their child to read a certain book. The book give their child a nightmare or two but hopefully that is an indicator that they don't want to read that book again. So the next time they say i want to go to the library to get a couple of books they will get a better book that won't give them a nightmare. You got to remember you was a child once. When you was a child you liked certain books too and you didn't want to be told that you was not allowed to read the books you liked. If parents approve the books the library should be allowed to carry them. If I went to the library and my favorite book or series of books were not there anymore because parents didn't agree with the fact of them having the book in the library i would be a little upset. Do you like to read blood and gorry books? Just because you are interested in that type of book don't mean that you are going to turn out like the story. Also that doesn't mean you are a bad person either. Children know what they like and they know what they want to read.

5903,2,"Should certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person decide if a book is good or bad and everyone agree with that choice? With all of the different types of people in the world, somebody has to disagree. No, they should not be removed at all. Every single person has a different point of view towards certain things. My favorite books are children's books, older adults might find those books as trash and they might want to get rid of them. If one person decided if somthing is good or bad material then there wouldnt be anything left. For every single object in the world, there is somebody that does not like it. If everytime somebody read a book off the shelf and didnt like it, then there most likely would not be anymore books and movies left for people to enjoy. Magazines for example are all made to entertain a certain audience. I would never read a womens fashion magazine, so I would be the one to throw that off the shelf. If i did that then there would be some men and women that agree but still a large percentage of women would not agree with me. There is no such thing as a perfect book, movie, or magazine. The reason why there are libraries and seperate movie theaters, is for people to choose which one they want to enjoy. Another idea why all materials need to stay is that people like variety. Depending on what mood a person is in, helps decide on what kind genre they choose that day. A reason why the world is such a crazy place is because of the wide variety of opinions that everyone has. One man's trash is another man's treasure.

5904,2,"Censorship in libraries has gotten stronger over the years and I agree with it. Libraries are where people have the freedom of choosing a book without worrying if it's going to be inappropriate or not. I never have encountered an inappropriate book from a library and I hope noone ever has. I think books, music, movies, etc., should be removed from a library if it's pornographic, offends race or culture or is extremely inappropriate. I think books, music, movies, etc., should be removed from libraries if they are pornographic. There is no room in public places for that kind of garbage. If people watch or read that stuff on their own, that's their own choice. The population doesn't want a or year old kid walking through a library, seeing a pornographic book and asking his/her parent what that means. That would be totally unacceptable. Libraries are suppose to have some sort of respect for their customers. Another reason books, movies, etc., should be removed from a library is if there is offense to any race or culture of any kind. wrote a great book titled 'A that has to do with an african-@CAPS1 male killing two white men who raped his year old daughter. Its a great book but there is a lot of racism in it and some people might find that extremely offensive. history already overcame one bout with racism and another wouldn't be good. People in the middle east might get offended if an wrote a book bashing the cultures in the middle east. Just like would get upset if an athiest wrote book stating that there is no and explaining his/her beliefs why there isn't. If people want to buy those books at stores like that's fine but libraries shouldn't carry those books. No library wants to have lawsuits because they had a racist book in their library. If a book, movie, etc., is extremely inappropriate then it should be banned from libraries. School libraries are strict on what can be in their books and what con't be in the books they carry. I don't see our high school library with movies like in it and that's because its inappropriate. I think that movies like that are fine but I've watched movies that I can't begin to believe were in movie theatres and people paid money to see it. One movie I watched was so bad my friend and I turned off the about minutes into the movie because it was extremely horrendus. I think a book, movie, etc., should be banned from libraries if it's pornographic, offends any race or culture or is extremely inappropriate. Some people react more to these type of things than others but you can't please everyone all the A great resolution to this problem would be putting labels on the books, movies, etc., that some poeple might find offensive. Maybe designating some areas in libraries to war books, movies, etc., and designating another section to the books, movies, etc., with racism in them. This would keep the books, movies, etc., open to the public while warning people that they can be offensive to some people but fine to others.",8830,8831.0,Censorship libraries gotten stronger years I agree  Libraries people freedom choosing book without worrying s going inappropriate  I never encountered inappropriate book library I hope noone ever  I think books  music  movies  etc  removed library s pornographic  offends race culture extremely inappropriate  I think books  music  movies  etc  removed libraries pornographic  There room public places kind garbage  If people watch read stuff  s choice  The population nt want year old kid walking library  seeing pornographic book asking hisher parent means  That would totally unacceptable  Libraries suppose sort respect customers  Another reason books  movies  etc  removed library offense race culture kind  wrote great book titled  A african  CAPS male killing two white men raped year old daughter  Its great book lot racism people might find extremely offensive  history already overcame one bout racism another would nt good  People middle east might get offended wrote book bashing cultures middle east  Just like would get upset athiest wrote book stating explaining hisher beliefs nt  If people want buy books stores like s fine libraries nt carry books  No library wants lawsuits racist book library  If book  movie  etc  extremely inappropriate banned libraries  School libraries strict books co nt books carry  I nt see high school library movies like s inappropriate  I think movies like fine I ve watched movies I ca nt begin believe movie theatres people paid money see  One movie I watched bad friend I turned minutes movie extremely horrendus  I think book  movie  etc  banned libraries s pornographic  offends race culture extremely inappropriate  Some people react type things others ca nt please everyone A great resolution problem would putting labels books  movies  etc  poeple might find offensive  Maybe designating areas libraries war books  movies  etc  designating another section books  movies  etc  racism  This would keep books  movies  etc  open public warning people offensive people fine others 
5905,2,"Everyone has a right to their own opinions and religious views. Not everyone agrees with each other, but people should respect the fact that not everyone has the same opinion as the person that is sitting next to them. I don't agree that certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should be taken off the shelf just because some people find them offensive, because to other people it might be what they agree with. People need to be considerate of others. We are all human beings and it is a free country. If you remove books from shelves then you are taking someone's beliefs and saying that it is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and views. For example, if there is a book about and you are an that doesn't give you a right to take that book down just because you don't believe in Many people do believe in so that wouldn't be fair to them. In my opinion, if you think a certain book is offensive then don't check it out. You don't have to make a scene about it. As long as you know what your own beliefs and religious views are, then you shouldn't worry about what others' are. Everyone is equal and deserves to be open about what they believe in. Another example would be gay people and straight people. If you see a movie with a gay person in it and you don't agree with it, then that's your choice. Maybe gay people don't agree with straight people, but since that is what is common they can't make a scene about it like most people do about gay people. Everyone has a different way of approaching life. It all comes down to whether or not you are considerate of others and can let them be happy with what they believe in. You shouldn't try to put others down just because you don't agree. If they are happy then you should let them be happy for them and not try to put them down and make them feel bad about themselves, or different. A last example would be the way you dress. Most people judge others on their appearance. If someone dresses in all black or has a lot of tatoos, people jump to conclusions and atomatically think that that person is a freak. The saying says that you should 'never judge a book by its cover.' I completely agree with that. Everyone is different and has a different unique style. That is what makes the world an exciting place. I would hate to live in a world where everyone was perfect and everyone was the same. People need to grow up and stop only thinking about themselves for a change.

5906,2,"My personal opinion on whether certain materials should be removed from libraries or not would be answered as no; they shouldn't. I believe that whether different things could be found as offensive or not it shouldn't matter if they are on the shelves in a library. If libraries are ordering certain issues in magazines, or different books, or music then they should be able to be available to the public. Many magazines, music, and books that could be considered offensive to one person; but could be very useful to someone else and see it in a completely different way. If things are put in a library on the shelves that means it should be available to anyone and everyone. The things put out on the shelves, they are there for a reason, for anyone to look at or to check out. Also many things in a library are quite usful to many people. Many things now of days could be considered offensive to different people, but it's how you look at something can also change that point of view. I see it as, if an article or anything is set out to be checked out, it should be able to do so. I believe that if somebody doesn't like something about that certain thing, they have every right to tell the librarian, but everybody is entitled to their own opinion, but that doesn't mean it should be completely taken out of a library because one or a few people say so. I think that if people start trying to get offensive items from libraries taken out then that could very easily start unneeded contreversy. Many times I go into a library and see something i not personally like, but everyones opinions and outlooks on things can vary. Nobodys opinions are always going to be the same. In some cases things that could be considered offensive, they can be taught or learned about in schools, or college. Research especially could be harder to do if offensive things get taken out of libraries because many things can be considered that. For example; music. Taking out different kinds of music because it is offensive isn't right. Many people like different types of music, no matter what it is. Something one person hate, another love. It isn't fair to take out certain things due to it being offensive. In one way or another everything can be taken in offense, maybe not to one person but it could to another. If certain materials start to be removed from the shelves in libraries eventually we will have nothing left.

5907,2,"I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, ext., should be removed from library shelves if they are found offensive. There are many people that I have seen that complain about what is found at the library. Because of young children, and people feeling like they are being pointed out, certain materials should be removed from library shelves. Young children love the library. The reason why is because of all the activities the library provides for them. Reading books for prizes, computer games, and learning how to read is found enjoyable to them. I know for a fact that parents would not like to find out there child picked up a book about gang activity. Nor would they like for their child to hear dirty music in the music area. These can put unecessary images in to their kids mind. It is not the right age for them to learn about that kind of behavior. It hurts when you are being pointed out in front of your friends by other people. Imagine if you were gay, and there are library books about how wrong being gay is. Right then and there, you feel like you are being thrown in the gutter. Library customers go to the library because it is nice and quiet. The last thing they want to do is read a book, hear a song, or watch a movie basically about them just in different context. Information about those kinds of things should not be found in a library. The last thing the library wants to do is lose its customers. Same goes for any business. The library I am talking about is the public one. School library's aren't as absurd on information. Customers will not come to the library if they feel like their comfortability is gone. Parent's do not want their child reading, watching, or hearing information they don't need to know yet. The young children, and people who are being pointed out, are my reasons to why the not needed information should be removed from library shelves. Public library's should be very similar to a school's. The main difference would only be size. In conclusion, all unecessary information must be removed from all library shelves",8836,8837.0,I believe certain materials  books  music  movies  magazines  ext  removed library shelves found offensive  There many people I seen complain found library  Because young children  people feeling like pointed  certain materials removed library shelves  Young children love library  The reason activities library provides  Reading books prizes  computer games  learning read found enjoyable  I know fact parents would like find child picked book gang activity  Nor would like child hear dirty music music area  These put unecessary images kids mind  It right age learn kind behavior  It hurts pointed front friends people  Imagine gay  library books wrong gay  Right  feel like thrown gutter  Library customers go library nice quiet  The last thing want read book  hear song  watch movie basically different context  Information kinds things found library  The last thing library wants lose customers  Same goes business  The library I talking public one  School library s nt absurd information  Customers come library feel like comfortability gone  Parent s want child reading  watching  hearing information nt need know yet  The young children  people pointed  reasons needed information removed library shelves  Public library s similar school s  The main difference would size  In conclusion  unecessary information must removed library shelves
5908,2,"I believe that books, music, movies, and magazines should stay on the book shelves at the libraries. If someone is really looking for a certain material and the library doesn't have it, then that will make the person who needs the information have to go other places for the information. I also believe that the library is a place to go and get information about anything you want too know about. Or you can just go to the library and sit and relax to sit there and watch a movie or listen to some music. Taking things off the shelf would just make it harder on people to find and do things they like to do at a library. Taking down certain things off the shelf is not a good choice to consider. When I went to the library one evening and I saw that I couldn't find a book on The librarian told me that they moved it off the shelf and I would have to get a copy off the internet. Well i didn't like that idea, because printing at the library is for every page, so I ask her 'what was the reason that the book was taking down'? she told me that that they had too take the book down off the shelf because no one had come in to take a look at the book over years. If the book was on the shelf for years and no one ever checked it out then I still wouldn't have taken the book down, because maybe a certain indiviual stayed at the library all day and did there research there. You never know what someone does with something if you don't pay attention. Going to the library you find things to do and research is the main reason why people would go to a library. If they have an important project thats due for school and the book that used to be on the shelves are not anymore, that can make a person really angry. And that will also make them have to go on the internet for more reasons. using the internet is not always best because you have websites that don't have the right information and that can lead to the person getting a major bad grade in the class for not having the right information. If you just keep everything in its right place at a library then no one will have to worry about getting bad or wrong information. Most of the time when I go to the library I will sit in the back and listen to music and do my homework. Because thats the only place I could get peace and quiet to myself. If the library didn't have the ear phones anymore or the music I like listening to at the library no more than I wouldn't be able to go there anymore for the reasons I like going the most. Or maybe when I go to the library i'll watch a movie that we don't have at home there because that movie might not be selling nomore and the library is the only place to go. Well if they take the movies out the library then where can I find the movies? Believing that each thing in the library is set there for the people intentions to do better in school and just have a nice peaceful day at the library, taking things out would not be more exciting as usual. In conclusion libraries are a place to do you research and listen to music or just read a book. If you take everything down or out the library than what would people do then. They want have anywhere else to find there information, listen to music, or watch a movie. I just like everything to stay where they are so there want be any complications. Keeping everything in it's place at the library there shouldn't be any worries about getting bad or wrong information or not having fun at the library as you would usually do",8838,8839.0,I believe books  music  movies  magazines stay book shelves libraries  If someone really looking certain material library nt  make person needs information go places information  I also believe library place go get information anything want know  Or go library sit relax sit watch movie listen music  Taking things shelf would make harder people find things like library  Taking certain things shelf good choice consider  When I went library one evening I saw I could nt find book The librarian told moved shelf I would get copy internet  Well nt like idea  printing library every page  I ask what reason book taking   told take book shelf one come take look book years  If book shelf years one ever checked I still would nt taken book  maybe certain indiviual stayed library day research  You never know someone something nt pay attention  Going library find things research main reason people would go library  If important project thats due school book used shelves anymore  make person really angry  And also make go internet reasons  using internet always best websites nt right information lead person getting major bad grade class right information  If keep everything right place library one worry getting bad wrong information  Most time I go library I sit back listen music homework  Because thats place I could get peace quiet  If library nt ear phones anymore music I like listening library I would nt able go anymore reasons I like going  Or maybe I go library ll watch movie nt home movie might selling nomore library place go  Well take movies library I find movies  Believing thing library set people intentions better school nice peaceful day library  taking things would exciting usual  In conclusion libraries place research listen music read book  If take everything library would people  They want anywhere else find information  listen music  watch movie  I like everything stay want complications  Keeping everything s place library nt worries getting bad wrong information fun library would usually
5909,2,"In this world we live in not everyone is going to like every single thing that is published or written. My view of this situation is everyone is always going to have a problem with a certain item. There was a time I had gotten a book to read in the libary and it had some graphic details that I found rather offensive. When I put the book back though I never once picked it back up to read, because I knew what was in it. There was also this time one of my friends had gotten a book and had been so upset about the contains she had threw it in the trash. Some people enjoy things other don't but that is no reason to start pulling all the books off the libary shelfs. There be materials that some like and other don't but if we just start taking things away what are we going to have left. Such as in school the teachers are not allowed to show videos unless they pretain to the subject they are teaching. Now if I'm not mistaken there are not alot of videos about and very few about writting. So in some ways how can we decide between what some want and what some don't we can't. If there happens to be a certain book, music, movie or anything you find offensive just stay clear of it. When you know you don't like a certain item don't go blazing a storm, because you never know who just might like it. So I ask you how do you know what we can have and what we can't just because someone says 'I don't like that'. If we were to get rid everything someone doesn't like we would have nothing left in this world. It would be as if one person doesn't like horror so we do away with all of them, so what do we say to someone who really likes them 'sorry you can't read horror anymore because he or she doesn't like them'.

5910,2,"Have you ever seen a book in the library that makes you want to say 'why would anyone ever read this book, its so offensive and inapropreate.'? Well i have a couple of times, but that doesnt really bother me. Parents now have to deal with drug abuse, violence, and cursing within children and teens. Not all of these are because of video games, movies or music, though those do influence children, they also come from books. Arn't parnets suppost to want their children to read books, my parents always told me to read, that it would make me smarter. Now parents have to be conserned whether or not there learning about poems and novels or about them reading a book that has some forty five year old drop out, whose life is getting alcohol, and doing drugs. Im not saying read about poneys and faries, just not about drugs and alcohol. Im in no way saying that books dont have offensive words in them, i know they do i just read three of them. What i am saying is that by takeing away those books we are takeing away childrens education. Those children wont get the information in those books because they just censored them and threw them out. For example in the book The They does use curse words but to an extent of it not hurting anyone. I have noticed not all books lead children to cursing and alcohol abuse. It all depends on the book your reading. if you're reading about how to become a dropout and how to do drugs then yea you're child might learn to do those thins but books like The They wont. Sure they do curse a little but this book dosnt talk about doing drugs, it talks about war, and when there is war there is cursing. I do believe that librarys should censor movies and music more heavily than books. Librarys should be more strict on rap and hip hop. These typesof music are more about doing drugs and getting women, and would influence children more. To me music is much worse because the artist is telling you about those drugs and alcohol. Movies are the same way, i dont believe that i have seen more than five movies that didnt have someone kiss, or get intement. These movies, music, and books set examples for children, and i'm concerned because in the next ten years i will probobaly have children of my own, and i dont want them exposed to these ideas. Now there is a bad side to censoring librarys. One way is we are takeing out books that can be helpful to childrens minds. We are taking away childrens knowledge, we are makeing them not get as good of an education as we wanted them to. Then we tuen arounf and blame schools for not teaching them well enough, when the parents are the ones to blame. So therefor i cant win, if we censor librarys we would be ruining childrens education by takeing away books, or if we dont censor librarys we are teaching children about drugs and alcohol. But if it were up to me i wouldnt censor librarys.",8842,8843.0,Have ever seen book library makes want say why would anyone ever read book  offensive inapropreate   Well couple times  doesnt really bother  Parents deal drug abuse  violence  cursing within children teens  Not video games  movies music  though influence children  also come books  Ar nt parnets suppost want children read books  parents always told read  would make smarter  Now parents conserned whether learning poems novels reading book forty five year old drop  whose life getting alcohol  drugs  Im saying read poneys faries  drugs alcohol  Im way saying books dont offensive words  know read three  What saying takeing away books takeing away childrens education  Those children wont get information books censored threw  For example book The They use curse words extent hurting anyone  I noticed books lead children cursing alcohol abuse  It depends book reading  re reading become dropout drugs yea re child might learn thins books like The They wont  Sure curse little book dosnt talk drugs  talks war  war cursing  I believe librarys censor movies music heavily books  Librarys strict rap hip hop  These typesof music drugs getting women  would influence children  To music much worse artist telling drugs alcohol  Movies way  dont believe seen five movies didnt someone kiss  get intement  These movies  music  books set examples children  m concerned next ten years probobaly children  dont want exposed ideas  Now bad side censoring librarys  One way takeing books helpful childrens minds  We taking away childrens knowledge  makeing get good education wanted  Then tuen arounf blame schools teaching well enough  parents ones blame  So therefor cant win  censor librarys would ruining childrens education takeing away books  dont censor librarys teaching children drugs alcohol  But wouldnt censor librarys 
5911,2,"Why should you be able to remove things from a shelf that are offensive? Well I don't think that you should be able to. If you let someone remove something than everyone else will be want to and like Katherine Paterson said then there would be nothing left to read. I will now tell you through experiences, observations, and readings why you shouldn't be able to. People have alot of different experiences everyday in life. This experience shows that if you let one person remove one thing it will lead to another person wanting to remove something else. This experience came through sports, the players started to wear there pant legs down instead of up like they have always been seen in This started about five to ten years ago and now alot of high school and younger althletes are starting to follow what the professional players started. This experience proves that once one person does it another person will want to. In my life I've seen people follow eachother once a trend got started. I think that if you let one person chose to take any reading material off of a shelf because they find it offending then other people will observe this and want to do the same. I mean think about it if you would observe someone taking a certain book you liked off of a shelf that you liked, wouldn't you want to take off one of theirs? This is one reason why people shouldn't be allowed to do this. Reading material can vary dramatically from emotional poems to sports magazines and then to the everyday paper. there are trillions of people in the world and not everyone wants to read the same thing. I enjoy reading sports articles and adventure or mystery books. Although if you would walk up to my bestfriend they would probably say they like three completely different things. Reading certain things and what you like is all matter of opinion and no one should be able to take that away from you. In we live off the word freedom and being able to do whatever we want with guidelines. If you would give people the right to take any book they wanted off the shelves then i think that there would be nothing left to read. There are so many people out there and im sure everyone of them has there likes and dislikes. So I think you shouldn't be able to do this because of the experiences, observations, and readings that I've be through and have read in life",8844,8845.0,Why able remove things shelf offensive  Well I nt think able  If let someone remove something everyone else want like Katherine Paterson said would nothing left read  I tell experiences  observations  readings nt able  People alot different experiences everyday life  This experience shows let one person remove one thing lead another person wanting remove something else  This experience came sports  players started wear pant legs instead like always seen This started five ten years ago alot high school younger althletes starting follow professional players started  This experience proves one person another person want  In life I ve seen people follow eachother trend got started  I think let one person chose take reading material shelf find offending people observe want  I mean think would observe someone taking certain book liked shelf liked  would nt want take one  This one reason people nt allowed  Reading material vary dramatically emotional poems sports magazines everyday paper  trillions people world everyone wants read thing  I enjoy reading sports articles adventure mystery books  Although would walk bestfriend would probably say like three completely different things  Reading certain things like matter opinion one able take away  In live word freedom able whatever want guidelines  If would give people right take book wanted shelves think would nothing left read  There many people im sure everyone likes dislikes  So I think nt able experiences  observations  readings I ve read life
5912,2,"Everyone can remember a book, magazine, movie, or music video that we found offensive. The biggest problem is figuring out what to do with these media clips. Some people think that they should just be thrown away, tossed out, or deleted. Others think that we should let people decide for themselves what they beleive is offensive and just try to avoid such topics. This is the side I stand on. If everybody on earth were to get rid of anything media related that they found dirty, offensive, or boring then no one would have any media at all. This is why I beleive that these things should be decided by individuals and personally avoided, rather than getting rid of them. People pride themselves on being individual. Nobody wants to be the exact copy of another and one way for us to express this individualism is through the media. Such things as what songs we listen to, what type of music we like, what movies we watch or like, and what shows we watch are just ways that we express our own personalities. If someone who likes alternative music were told that it was found to offensive and that no alternative would ever be heard again they would be upset. The same goes for those who like romantic comedy movies. Sure, the people who found such types of music or movies revolting would be happy but what if their music became banned too. The people who wish to throw out all media found boring, tacky, rude, or wasteful do not realize that their media would be gone as well. If they did know they would not wish that. The simple fact is that all music, movies, videos, magazines, or books are found terrible by someone, and to be fair, that someone has a right to their opinion, but they should not be allowed to just throw out what they don'@CAPS1 like. If we all had a choice wether to listen to good music or bad music, we would choose good. We do have this choice and it's presented every time we turn on the radio, or the or every time we read a book. We watch shows because we like them, and the ones we don'@CAPS1 like we don'@CAPS1 watch. It not seem like it to the people who side against me but we choose to ignore media we do not like everyday. Since we are already doing it, why stop? There is no need for me to call the producers of '@CAPS2' and tell them to cancel the show. I simply choose not to watch it. If enough people choose not to watch it then it's ratings will drop and they will eventually have to cancel it. The minority not like this but everyone is the minority at one point in their life. You win some, you lose some, and everyone is happy. This is why I think we should not be allowed to take books off shelves in libraries.

5913,2,"With all media there are choices to be made. Any time you flip on your television or go to the movie store, you have to decide what you want to watch. When you turn on your radio or look through cds you have to decide what you want to listen to. These are basic decisions that most people face multiply times a day. You alone get the chance to pick what you want or need to be watching or listening to. You get the freedom to pick what you desire and going to the library shouldn't be any different. The library is a place for all races, ages, genders, cultures and religions. The public uses this place as a source of knowledge. The books, magazines, and movies here can help people in multiply ways from their jobs to school, and even to find out what could be making them sick. These sources of media help people get certain things accomplished and better their knowledge on whichever topic they are researching. The library should not cenor certain pieces of media because some people find them offensive. This isn't fair to those who need these sources for work, school, or for their own pure enjoyment. The fact that someone might be going there to get informatio, on a subject that someone else find offensive, and then search and search to find that the information on the subject has been put away is a total dissapointment and waste of time. They should be able to depend on the library to have articles, book, magazines, and documentaries on whatever topic they be researching. Saying that our country is free and that we have a freedom of speech would not be supported by the fact that certain materials are put away just because someone take offense to it. Children's minds are getting polluted daily. Whether your child is hanging out with their friends or walking to school they will alwys find out things they shouldn't know for years, and have worries that only adults should have. There is no way to prevent a child from the world. They live in it so they are in fact going to have to deal with what's inside of it and learn from it. If it's the children that people are worried about seeing offensive materials, then there are many ways to make sure that doesn't happen. Parents who are concerned that their son or daughter come across something in the library that is too violent, sexual, or mature for them, have many possible alternatives. They could always stay with their child so they know that what they see is what they're child will also see. Also, in most libraries there is a childrens' section. Knowing that those are only books for kids you could put them in that area. If worse comes to worse and the parents don't want to take the risk at all of their son or daughter running into something to mature for them, then they could always go to the library for them. No matter where a child goes there will always be a risk of them comming across something they shouldn't, and if you're optimistic about the situation then them learning something ahead of time turn out to be a good thing. Libraries are for the public and therefore should be able to talk about public things. For example, I am completley and totally against abortion. I think that it is against nature and for me, it's against my religion. Having said this, I would not be offended what so ever to find books or even magazines discussing abortion is a positive manner. I think it is everyones' choice to decide what they want, and they should be able to read about people that agree with them. The world will be more pulluted with offensive subjects and topics every day. I think that the least we can do is have a place to go where we can learn about them freely. Libraries should not be censored because we as should be free to learn and read about what interests us without feeling ashamed because what we want to check out is in the restricted section. That could just be completely embarrassing. Censoring one public place would just make people realize that we have bad events going on in our world and we obviously can't face them if we ask the librarians to move certain things to the back room. Everyone should have the oppurtunity to reseach, and holding us back from learning would be against our contitution.

5914,2,"Although teenage readers like to wild-out, listen to music, watch rap videos, also goto partys, and are in the begining phases of being in relationships, books aren't ment to condome or influence these 'ghetto' or '@CAPS1- behaviors. It is the young ones that make their own decessions and it is the parenting that either stops or allows them to do what ever goes on, so don't blame literacher. Growing up living with only your mom and brother no father could be very hard on most hearts of young or even older teens. Parenting/ have such big roles when dealing with how children are raised and introduced to the real world. With the population steadly increasing by babies a minute, it takes pride and consistancy to live it up and teach all these children right from wrong and its up to them that by the age and up to understand between the two also. So when people are constantly asking- '@CAPS4 does your son sag, and act like he is a thug? When he goes to a college prep school?' or '@CAPS4 do you let your teenage girl wear small shorts with her stomach showing?' The answer... only they (the teens) know. Music have sounds, movies are videos, not big brothers or sisters they only reflect an image, and its the images that cause teens to become ambiguious and loose self-disciplane that parents should have tought them any way. Teens don't care most of the time what they hear, other wise they would be obeying their parents, and doing what they are told by getting all A's and doing productive things with their time instead of smoking, drinking, and to relate to todays teenage life to keep it copeastetic, having sex... teens don't function well with hearing they ironicly retaliate off of what they see not what they read or write. So if they see their parents are crack heads, they will be just as good as a crack head. Books have came along way and the terms and titles that teenage people get from books can be sickning also but I personally think that if you were to remove any thing off them selves it should be movies. Any one can get a movie, most (@CAPS6) teens don't bother reading books any more, but the female populatiion of teen women love the books about the girls that get raiped, pregnant, and have boy friend drama. so the girls are influenced by books,and the males are inspired by the rap songs, and 'hood' movies. I have a very good remany, maybe if the movies that have the violence could have less of that and try to teach the minds of teenage males on becoming successful and picking up on the work life after school and college, and the books the females read can talk less about the personal and teach more about becoming a women and offer convient tips on life and how to prevent becoming a high school drop out.

5915,2,"Think about how you felt about the library as a child. In a section made just for you, you marveled at the games, puzzels, and picture books just waiting for you to get your hands on them. I remember dreading walking through the adult section with my mom while she picked out a book for herself. Not too many years later, I grew out of picture books and started reading more challenging chapter books. Now here I am in my teenage years reading long chapter books and magazines. Through all these years of going to the library, I do not have one recollection of being exposed to something I should not have been exposed to. I believe that if children, adolescents, and adults all use the library in the way it is designed to be used and parents take care of their kids, materials will not have the need to be censored. Firstly, what is there to be worried about young children being corrupted with materials at the library? Children from newborns to years old are practically allergic to anything outside of the children's section. Not only do they not want to read adult books or anything that could pose a threat, they are not even allowed to check out books without a parent. Any decent parent would not purposely check out something inappropriate for their child. I remember a time when my mom had a book on her dresser that I asked if I could read. It had a pretty cover illustration of a fairy with long hair and a beautiful dress. I picked it up but she told me it was not an appropriate book for me to read. That is appropriate censorship that does not prevent others from the joy of reading that particular book. Adolescents through are, in my opinion, the other group people worry about censoring things for. In most libraries, in addition the the children's section, there is an area specific to the interests of teenagers. This includes magazines, music, and more advanced books. The readers can check out their own books and are beginning to make their own decisions with a little parental supervision. I would like to know what is the worst that could happen from a teenager reading something they are not ready for. I believe that if this happens, they will only develop a stronger conscience from it if they feel it is not right, or learn about something from a book that they could learn in a worse way later on. And if reading something from a book is the worst thing a teenager is doing, I think that is pretty good. There are many worse things they could be spending their time on than reading a book or other media. Thirdly, I belive the age group and over should not be worried about at all for censorship. Adults make their own decisions, so who is to tell them what they can or cannot read? This is also the age group that decides what the younger children read. They themselves are the censor for the children, so there should not be any need to take a book off the shelves if there is already a filter that keeps innapropriate media from youth. In conclusion, materials should not be removed from the shelves just because they are seen as inappropriate to a certain party. What is seen as bad to one person, be perfectly okay to another. If the library is used properly, and the age specific areas are respected there should not be a need for censorship",8852,8853.0,Think felt library child  In section made  marveled games  puzzels  picture books waiting get hands  I remember dreading walking adult section mom picked book  Not many years later  I grew picture books started reading challenging chapter books  Now I teenage years reading long chapter books magazines  Through years going library  I one recollection exposed something I exposed  I believe children  adolescents  adults use library way designed used parents take care kids  materials need censored  Firstly  worried young children corrupted materials library  Children newborns years old practically allergic anything outside children s section  Not want read adult books anything could pose threat  even allowed check books without parent  Any decent parent would purposely check something inappropriate child  I remember time mom book dresser I asked I could read  It pretty cover illustration fairy long hair beautiful dress  I picked told appropriate book read  That appropriate censorship prevent others joy reading particular book  Adolescents  opinion  group people worry censoring things  In libraries  addition children s section  area specific interests teenagers  This includes magazines  music  advanced books  The readers check books beginning make decisions little parental supervision  I would like know worst could happen teenager reading something ready  I believe happens  develop stronger conscience feel right  learn something book could learn worse way later  And reading something book worst thing teenager  I think pretty good  There many worse things could spending time reading book media  Thirdly  I belive age group worried censorship  Adults make decisions  tell read  This also age group decides younger children read  They censor children  need take book shelves already filter keeps innapropriate media youth  In conclusion  materials removed shelves seen inappropriate certain party  What seen bad one person  perfectly okay another  If library used properly  age specific areas respected need censorship
5916,2,"I believe that things should be censored so that kids cannot get ahold of something they shouldn't. A big problem is that when kids are at a library their parents think that maybe they dont have to watch them which is even worse because then what if your kid went outside for some reason. Parents should always watch they kids no matter where they are. I think that they should put up walls to separate the sections from on another, then at where you walk into the they would be an employee turning kids around and pointing them back to the kids The libraries are already separated into the different sections it is just that when on bookshelf ends and another begins, and all there is a paper that says,'@CAPS1 and the next is adult the kids are going to keep walking farther into it not knowing the difference. The next is checking out movies from the library. All the movies are going to be in the same They put the shelves of rated movies up higher to a where the poeple who should beable to see them can. Then the could be even closer to the ground, then and could be closest to the ground. the people should see how old the kids are if they are too young to rent a rated movie then they don't get to rent the movie. The censoring of music seems to me to be the hardest. The reason why that seems to me is because every parent has different things they will let their kids listen to. There is not like rated music so the rating system goes on basically whatever your parents okay you to listen to. When they censor a very bad rap song they take out the bad words it still doesn't take out the other words that make the song about fighting, shooting, doing drugs, etc. Magazines are the worse than any book could ever because of the pictures that are in them. I have seen at and that there is a whole of adult magazines that are just sitting right in the open above like the mens They have most of the time like a plastic bag over them hiding the front covers and then they will have a suggestive slogan and maybe a girl on a motorcycle but still that is too much for a small kid to see. They try to separate them but the magazines start at on end and get porgressivly worse as they go. Overall I just want Libraries, bookstores and movie rental stores to try to make their products into seaparate categories based on age. Poeple should also watch there kids anywhere their kids could get into some trouble. I am not asking you to take bad things out of the libraries, bookstores, etc I am asking you to separate them better",8854,8855.0,I believe things censored kids get ahold something nt  A big problem kids library parents think maybe dont watch even worse kid went outside reason  Parents always watch kids matter  I think put walls separate sections another  walk would employee turning kids around pointing back kids The libraries already separated different sections bookshelf ends another begins  paper says    CAPS next adult kids going keep walking farther knowing difference  The next checking movies library  All movies going They put shelves rated movies higher poeple beable see  Then could even closer ground  could closest ground  people see old kids young rent rated movie nt get rent movie  The censoring music seems hardest  The reason seems every parent different things let kids listen  There like rated music rating system goes basically whatever parents okay listen  When censor bad rap song take bad words still nt take words make song fighting  shooting  drugs  etc  Magazines worse book could ever pictures  I seen whole adult magazines sitting right open like mens They time like plastic bag hiding front covers suggestive slogan maybe girl motorcycle still much small kid see  They try separate magazines start end get porgressivly worse go  Overall I want Libraries  bookstores movie rental stores try make products seaparate categories based age  Poeple also watch kids anywhere kids could get trouble  I asking take bad things libraries  bookstores  etc I asking separate better
5917,2,"Dear Newspaper, I think that offensive things in the library should remain in the library. The library needs to make a section on all the offensive things they have so people who are offended can stay away from that area but, like if someone had to do a paper on the war. That whole time period could be very offensive towards people but, its facts about our country so I think that should be in the library. People shouldn't have say that offensive things shouldn't be in the library. The same people who are affended by what I read. I am just as effended by what they read. Its a library, books are books people like some books some don't like books at all. I say if you are affended by this book or anyother book for that matter don't worry about it and keep it out of mind becuase, who knows someone might like that book that you hate. So that person who does like it still has a chance to read it. Just think how you would feel if your favorite book wasn't in the library because it affended someone. How would that make you feel if you did that to someone? would you care just because you didn't like it? That doesn't mean other people don't like it just because you don't like. Thats why all books should remain in a library even if they are effensive to people theres a lot of people in the world and they don't all like the same books.

5918,2,"Katherine Paterson makes a good point when she talks about there being books in libraries that people don't want their kids to read. Now days though, taking books out of a library would not do much help to keep kids away from those types of books. Kids have so much access to the internet that they could look up anything they wanted. They could stumble upon something that is way worse than what they would find in a library. Taking the books off of the shelves and out of the libraries would probably cause frustration in the adults who are at the age of reading those kinds of books. The adults would be upset because a book they wanted to read would not be available to them. There are a few ways that these types of problems could be solved without having to take the books out of the library. One way to solve the problem is to put books, movie, magazines, and music that could be considered offensive in a seperate room that you have to be a certain age to enter. That way when kids are looking at books in the library they will never come across something that is offensive. If there is a book that they want that is in that seperate room they would have to be with their parents. That way their parents know what they are looking at, reading, or listening to. Another way to solve the problem would to have a library just for those types of books. There would also be an age limit to that. They would have to be old enough to enter that library and get those types of materials. That way parents can let their kids go into a library and not have to worry about what they might see, read, or hear. I would not want my young child walking through a library and seeing adult material books and magazines. I definately would not want them picking one up and going through it. So if everything was seperated I would feel much better about my child going into a library. I have walked through many libraries and seen things I would consider bad for a young kid to read. All it would take is for them to pick it up and look at it. I would be very angry at the library if I saw my child looking through an adult magazine or book. I do not think it is necessary to take all offensive things out of a library. There are many other ways to make sure kids are not able to get to them. There are ways to make sure everyone is happy and gets what they want. Taking books out of a library would be a little extreme.",8858,8859.0,Katherine Paterson makes good point talks books libraries people nt want kids read  Now days though  taking books library would much help keep kids away types books  Kids much access internet could look anything wanted  They could stumble upon something way worse would find library  Taking books shelves libraries would probably cause frustration adults age reading kinds books  The adults would upset book wanted read would available  There ways types problems could solved without take books library  One way solve problem put books  movie  magazines  music could considered offensive seperate room certain age enter  That way kids looking books library never come across something offensive  If book want seperate room would parents  That way parents know looking  reading  listening  Another way solve problem would library types books  There would also age limit  They would old enough enter library get types materials  That way parents let kids go library worry might see  read  hear  I would want young child walking library seeing adult material books magazines  I definately would want picking one going  So everything seperated I would feel much better child going library  I walked many libraries seen things I would consider bad young kid read  All would take pick look  I would angry library I saw child looking adult magazine book  I think necessary take offensive things library  There many ways make sure kids able get  There ways make sure everyone happy gets want  Taking books library would little extreme 
5919,2,"Cencorship in Libraries ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else' That is a quote from Katherine Paterson, that I think is a very eye-opening quote. So the question arises that, 'Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from libraries if they are found ofensive?' answer is to that is a big no! Even though I have not spent fair share of time in libraries, I still have seen examples of censorship in libraries, or should I say, lack of censorship in libraries. That is the way I believe it should be, and i will tell you why. Censorship is a very one sided thing in eyes. Either you are for censoring out things, or you are against it. Not many people are on the fence about it. I believe that most libraries around our area have over looked censoring out certain materials, and that is a good thing. Why should the library have to censor out one book, movie, or magazine, just because one person rents or looks at it and finds something offensive in it? Everyone is intitled to their own opinions about certain subjects. So one person who might have found that material to be 'offensive' another individiual might have found it to be something else. In the libraries I have been in, most of them have everything seperated out into specific areas, such as the movies are catgorized into their specific ratings. Books in certain areas are catgorized by their genres, or in specific age groups for people to read. I think the only way that a library should remove material is if you have maybe two or three complaining about the same peice of material. Then even after that the library should look at it and then see if maybe it should be moved to a different area of the library. Some libraries even have internet now, do you think someone is not bound to find something offensive on a website? The fact of the matter is that their are things in certain materials that some people find offensive, while other people do not. You cannot remove something a library just because one person does not like what is in it. In conclusion i believe that libraries should not be removing materials from their shelevs if it found offensive by one or two people. Everyone is intitled to their own opionions about the meaning of certain words, passages, or even the whole plot of a book or movie. After reading this I hope that you will agree that all materials should be left on shelves in libraries. The right person for that peice of material will find it, and that is what libraries are for.",8860,8861.0,Cencorship Libraries  But I right remove book shelf work I abhor also exactly right everyone else  That quote Katherine Paterson  I think eyeopening quote  So question arises  Do I believe certain materials removed libraries found ofensive   answer big  Even though I spent fair share time libraries  I still seen examples censorship libraries  I say  lack censorship libraries  That way I believe  tell  Censorship one sided thing eyes  Either censoring things   Not many people fence  I believe libraries around area looked censoring certain materials  good thing  Why library censor one book  movie  magazine  one person rents looks finds something offensive  Everyone intitled opinions certain subjects  So one person might found material offensive  another individiual might found something else  In libraries I  everything seperated specific areas  movies catgorized specific ratings  Books certain areas catgorized genres  specific age groups people read  I think way library remove material maybe two three complaining peice material  Then even library look see maybe moved different area library  Some libraries even internet  think someone bound find something offensive website  The fact matter things certain materials people find offensive  people  You remove something library one person like  In conclusion believe libraries removing materials shelevs found offensive one two people  Everyone intitled opionions meaning certain words  passages  even whole plot book movie  After reading I hope agree materials left shelves libraries  The right person peice material find  libraries 
5920,2,"Is taking literature off the shelves of libraries right? What about books that are going to gain one's knowledge of a time period or maybe possible future happenings? I think that people should not be able to take certain things off a shelf because of the wording or topic. For literature that is not age appropriate for some people, it should be emphasized what it is about and what those people will be reading. If someone clarifies this, than I do not think there is any reason to take it of the shelves. As far as movies, music, magazines, etc. goes, I think there should be the same response. Some books or other material convey a substantial topic, but sometimes do not use age appropriate reasoning. This does not mean the material is bad, it was just wrote in a different time period when it was okay to write they way they did or in a view of someone who feels strongly about it. For example, if a twelve year old were to check out a book that is about sexual intercourse, it should be stated clearly the topic. I am not saying that twelve year old could not handle such a topic or is not mature enough, but they should know in advance what they are checking out to read. Materials from libraries can also have a bad use of language that is not suitable for some people to read. For example, the book '@CAPS1 uses the word nigger a lot. In the time period in which this book was set it was normal for a black person to be called a nigger, and was very much so acceptable. Now if someone is to even say the word nigger, without referring to someone, they are accused of being a 'racist'. In some copies of this book, the word was taken out. What?! That is a part of that time that people learn about in history class, if we read the book in english class, shouldn't they be allowed to learn its entirety and full meaning? From my own personal experiences, such as '@CAPS1 I have not judged a author of a book by their topic or choice of wording. If a material is not a worthy topic or does not meet one's requirements of good literature, than don't read, listen, or watch it. Simple enough? I've asked many people what they think of the usage of the word nigger in '@CAPS1 and the majority say they think it clarifies what was normal and what really happened then. I do agree that some materials from libraries could be greatly debated as of to wether or not keep them on the shelves. I do think though, that if stated what the topic is, than there should not be a problem. For example, if parents do not like the literature that their kids are reading, than they should go with them to pick out a book, they should not complain and let them pick out another book that they will yet again get flustered about. Just because literature is not satisfactory to some, does not mean that others will have the same response.

5921,2,"Libraries have provided books of all types throughout the years. However, many people have an issue with some of the content that is available for anyone to read. For example, there are many books that can be racist or offensive to a group of people. While this might be true, people should be able to read what they want. Also, if it is a public library then there should not be censorship because it is called a 'public' library for a reason. If a person finds a piece of literature offensive, then they do not have to read it. Part of the reason that the is such a great place is because it is a free country. If you were to remove a piece of literature from a shelf because you find it offensive then that is violating our freedom rights. Authors has the right to put what they want in a book. Readers then, have the right to read it. This all ties in with our freedom of speech amendment. The whole point of having a public library is so that the 'public' can come and read what they like. If it were a private library then it would be understandable that they might censor what is being put on thier shelfs. However, at public libraries there shouldnt be a restriction. In addition, if a person really has an issue with a book then they can just not read it and advise others not to read it. Its simple as that. However, sometimes you dont know that a piece of literature is going to be offensive unless you actually read it. A potential solution to this problem would be to organize the books more effectivly so that people know what to expect. Also, have started to put stickers on them if they have questionable content. The sticker will say 'parental discretion is advised.' not use that same method for on books. Not only would it say 'parental discretion is advised,' but it should list the questionable factors that cause the lietarature to be offensive. In conclusioin, books should not be removed from the library shelves just because they be offensive. Books should be free for everybody to read because that is our free right. If a person really has a problem with the content, then they can simply not read it. However, there should be more organization that can let people know what they are reading to help avoid any potential problems.

5924,2,"Everyone has the right to '@CAPS1 of But do some people push that priviledge too far? I believe so. Invidiuals feel it is ok to talk about sex, drugs, and abuse like it is no big deal. To some people these things are offensive and in many books, movies, and music. Sex is a very common topic for many people. But is it really necessary to wright books, movies, and music for young adults about it? Yes, some teens have sex. But not all. Reading books and watching movies and heaaring music about it make teens feel it is ok to do it because it seems as if all teens are doing it. This is not true, not all teens are doing it. In some books I have read and movies I have watched they do not talk about the consequences of doing it. The chance of or teen pregnancy. Everyday I turn on the radio and at least one song usually pertains to sex. To most teens music is a big part of their lives. Should children and teens who listen to the radio hear the kind of stuff that some adults don't even want to hear. Drugs is another interesting and often read topic. It is well known that drugs affect society. Books, movies, and music that often explain the feeling people get when they are high actually persuade people to want to do it. Often teens already know the consequenes of using drugs. Reading in a book, watching a movie, or hearing a song about tons upon tons of people who do it daily might make them feel as if it is ok to do drugs. I have read many books and heard many songs about people who use drugs and they often get very violent with themsleves and other. Is this something that should be available on the shelves for your children to read? Another common topic is abuse. Whether it is physical, sexual, or emotional it is all hard to grasp. Some books, movies, and music that go in to detail of sexual abuse get very graphic. Personally not something I want to hear about nor do I want my future children to be exposed to this.

5925,2,"In libraries today there can be thousands of different types of books and other types of materials just sitting on the shelf. Some of those books and other materials be needed for educational purposes and others just for reading or watching in a spare moment that one might have. People never know what someone else might need or want. Therefore they should not remove the books from the shelf if they come upon a book and it is not what they want or that they find offensive. Most of the time when someone goes to the library they know about what they want before they go. This shows that it is all about a personal choice and how someone feels about a certain type or group of books. Sure not all people are going to agree with some types of books but they just can not take it off of the shelf. For example, in the quote Katherine Paterson she says,' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' this she means if one person has the right to take a book off of the shelf then so does everyone else. That would not be right because if that happen then all of the books would be gone. Therefore there would be no point in having libraries. Libraries and other people need to take her quote to heart and actually think about it. Books should be left on the shelf even if one finds it offensive because other people need or want that book. If a person does not like a book then they do not have to read it or be around it.

5929,2,I think that censorship should be removed from libraries should remove that kind of stuff and in public stores. To because little kids dont have to be in the kind of magazines because they are not old enough to even look at any type of stuff. Like that because they have no idea what it is and what they are looking for so if some kind of guy wants to buy something like than it should be over the counter you will have to buy it. Some more of my ideas are that i think school libraries should not have no such thing in there library becasuse everybody with just be going down to the library looking at them magazines. Some more censorness is the blood and gore and all that if they want to look at that bloodyness than they can wait till they get home. and not doing it at school where they have tl lean and not learn about blood and gore and all that so thats another thing i think should also be censored. Also maybe there should also be some kind of censorness to war book and videos or maybe not that but deffenetly killing and murder. All that becasue there could be some crazy kid that think he could get away with killing some one or anything. but i dont know there is just tones of stuff out there that needs to be censored So aslo the and over thing that comes up like if you have to be or over to do this surtain thing like parents dont evan pay attention to that. And if the child is doing it on his own than he or she could easily get by that because all you have to is put a diffrent date.

5931,2,"My views on censorship in libraries are simple. I don't believe items should be removed because it's up to the person checking out to choose what they want, some things can be are not found offensive to all beings, and some of the items can be put in areas where people of certain ages can not check out. Humans beings should all have their rights. If they walk into a library they expect to pick out a book they want. If libraries take out all the 'offensive' materials then there might not be much left to choose from. some become angered by this. When parents let their children come in they know that not all the sections are going to be kid friendly and should limit their child to a certain area if they please. Not all people think the same. This brings us to the point that while some people find some of the material offensive, not all will. People have different outlooks and different opinions. If someone were to find a book about, let's say, horses offensive and really enjoy the cat book, who's to say that someone else doesn't see the horse book as inappropriate but they see that cat book as being just that? That could eliminate over half of the books in the vicinity. If it comes down to it some books can be moved. THe libraries could make certain sections for the books. Like make and adult section and don't allow the children under a certain age to go in there. Have the small children with their picture books in a completely different side of the building. There are many ways this can be handled. Just because some people find some books offensive doesn't mean everyone does. Instead of taking all the books out they should find away around the problem because not all people find certain topics inappropriate, they can choose their own books, and sections can be made to seperate the books appropriatly.

5932,2,"I would say that you shouldn't remove the magazines, books, or the music books from the libraries. The reasson why I say that is because if it wasn't for the magazines, music, and certain books the world wouldn't be how it is today. It wouldn't be any famous people at all. I wouldn't be able to imagine this world without books, magazines, or music. Those three thinds persuade people in life in what to do. It helps us with ideas in what to do during our lifetime. To me the world would be worst than it is today. The rythym in the music helps us with things, like the way we walk, talk, think, and remember things. If it wasn't for the books, then we wouldn't even know how to read. I don't think that it would be a such thing as school. The books help us to communicate with people, things, and also our enviorments. It wouldn't be a such thing as definituions, or it probebly wouldn't be a such thing as a store. It wouldn't be a name for anything. If it wasn't for music then people wouldn't be able to express the way that they feel about other people or things. It sound a little strang but music help some people with thier feelings and the way that they think, it just depends on what type of music that you listen to. I would agree on keeping books, magazines, and music at libraries. Whats the point of it being a library if it doesn't have books. The only books that I would disagree on having at libraries are the adult books, the sexuality books. Those are the only types of books that shouldn't be there, because the kids are to young to be looking at those types of books.

5933,2,"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to rmove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Libraries have it all; books, magazines, music, movies, and etc. Though anyone of age can walk in and get what they want to. Libraries should censor the things that different aged people can get. They should organize their material to make it easier to find something for a specific age, or even by ethnic groups, also they should only let people check out material that is age appropiate to them. Would it not be easier to find something appropiate for someone if the material was divided into age and ethnic grouping? If the library was organized by certain age then it would much easier to keep track of where kids are getting their material from. Also it would make life a lot better for the people work at the library by making it very simple to know where things go and where to put them back. Someone checking out books for someone else could find it easily by knowing what age group they are in. Organization by ethnic groups could be simple for anyone of any race to go in and find something from their culture. This could be the same for religous groups as well. Kids can gain access to any movie, book, magazine, or music they like from the web and even at the local library. But is that material they have access to appropiate for them? If an eight year old kid brings home a rated movie, the parents of that child are not going to be happy. Although it is not the parents or the kids fault, the blame should be thrown towards the library for letting the kid check out that movie. So by cracking down and stopping kids from renting things that are not appropiate for their age, this should solve the problem. The librarians sould ask the kid how old he/she is and if his age does not match up with the material he is checking out then he should not be allowed to get without adult or parent aproval. If the material is in the age group where paople have to show idenification, the that should be inforced as well. Censorship can be very useful in am economy like this. If we could only take the tim to do a little organizing and watching what kids are able to get then our problems could be simply solved.

5934,2,"Censorship in libraries is a very important thing for young children. I believe that everyone should be able to read whatever they want, to a point. Books with extreme violence and offensive language should be censored from children. Books about history have certain pictures in them or words or even racual slers that children as certain ages to do not need to see or read. I believe it is our libraries job to sort these books out by age. Adults should be able to read any book they want and I believe that to be there choice but when it comes to children not everything is appropriate for them. Public libraries should hold whatever books they want but still keep them separated in the adult section but school libraries, such as elementary schools, should only carry books appropriate for that age group and again these books should be seperated by grade. Libraries also hold many other graphic things such as movies and music. I believe libraries should be required to keep certain movies in special adult sections based on violence and graphic material or the rating of the movie. Music on the other hand is much harder to sort but again many songs have graphic language not suitable for children and I believe music in libraries should have there music sorted my genre and the age group it is appropriate for. Libraries should be required to take certain precautions on who checkouts out some of there music, books, or movies because many of these things are not appropriate for children and I think these things should be taken into consideration.",8890,8891.0,Censorship libraries important thing young children  I believe everyone able read whatever want  point  Books extreme violence offensive language censored children  Books history certain pictures words even racual slers children certain ages need see read  I believe libraries job sort books age  Adults able read book want I believe choice comes children everything appropriate  Public libraries hold whatever books want still keep separated adult section school libraries  elementary schools  carry books appropriate age group books seperated grade  Libraries also hold many graphic things movies music  I believe libraries required keep certain movies special adult sections based violence graphic material rating movie  Music hand much harder sort many songs graphic language suitable children I believe music libraries music sorted genre age group appropriate  Libraries required take certain precautions checkouts music  books  movies many things appropriate children I think things taken consideration 
5935,2,"Many believe that they should know what kind of material their children are reading, listening to, and watching. But how can this be accomplished for all people to choose what is available for them? That is where a quote by author Katherine Paterson comes into play, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhore-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.' is saying, through this quote, that if one person had the right to remove something off of a shelf then everyone has that right. But if everyone has that right then very few to zero materials would be left. So should have the final say in what is being displayed to their children becuase it is their children who are being influenced in this society. There is a limit to what can be sensored from the children of this day. There is an abundance of material that is available at their fingertips, most of which is not appropriate for their age category. Once a child has viewed an inappropriate magazine cover, or heard an inappropriate song, etc., it forever be engraved in their minds. Is that what we want our children to be thinking of? Personally I think that should have the right to choose how to raise their children, and part of that is determined by what children are seeing on magazine covers in checkout isles in the store, the music that is played in public areas and movies that are showed to them at schools. The real question is where do you create the boundry line? Who should be deciding what is appropriate for children to view? People have different beliefs in how to raise their children. Some children have practically no boundries and are free to do as they please. While on the other hand some children have an abundance of rules about what they can or cannot do, see or view. While there is an absurdity to somethings that are availlable, there is also a practicallity to letting children see what the world is like. But there is no easy way of making sure that your innocent year-old doesn't see that practically nude woman on a magazine cover as you check out. should have the final authority of what their children view on a day to day basis. Part of a job is to make sure their children aren't growing up to fast, and by being exposed to some of these things will absolutely have an influence on how fast they develop in terms of what they think about. I believe that if a majority of people find a book, movie, magazine, music, or any type of media, etc., to be offensive we have the right as citizens to have them removed from our public areas. If any music or type of media is overwhelmingly filled with language that is hardly appropriate for adults, then it should definitelly be removed from any childs availability. The same would apply to any books or magazines, but also the use of nude pictures, or almost nude pictures is extremely unneccessary in any use. Any pornographic material should not be available to children, especially those who are very young. The content of the questionable items that are believed to be inappropriate should be reviewed and then taken out of the viewing area if a majority of people believe it to be inappropriate. In conclusion I believe that should have the final say in what is displayed for their children to see. As a I believe that children should not be viewing some of the things that they are able to see at this point in their life. Some of the material displayed is not healthy for anyone to be seeing let alone children. When you enter a library you want to enter a place theat is a safe environment for your children, not a place that you have to be worried about what they see or hear. So I believe that if a majority of people believe something to be offensive to them it should be heavily considered to be removed from the shelf or taken out of the viewing area",8892,8893.0,Many believe know kind material children reading  listening  watching  But accomplished people choose available  That quote author Katherine Paterson comes play  All us think book hope none children children taken shelf  But I right remove book shelf  work I abhore  also exactly right everyone else  And books left us   saying  quote  one person right remove something shelf everyone right  But everyone right zero materials would left  So final say displayed children becuase children influenced society  There limit sensored children day  There abundance material available fingertips  appropriate age category  Once child viewed inappropriate magazine cover  heard inappropriate song  etc  forever engraved minds  Is want children thinking  Personally I think right choose raise children  part determined children seeing magazine covers checkout isles store  music played public areas movies showed schools  The real question create boundry line  Who deciding appropriate children view  People different beliefs raise children  Some children practically boundries free please  While hand children abundance rules  see view  While absurdity somethings availlable  also practicallity letting children see world like  But easy way making sure innocent yearold nt see practically nude woman magazine cover check  final authority children view day day basis  Part job make sure children nt growing fast  exposed things absolutely influence fast develop terms think  I believe majority people find book  movie  magazine  music  type media  etc  offensive right citizens removed public areas  If music type media overwhelmingly filled language hardly appropriate adults  definitelly removed childs availability  The would apply books magazines  also use nude pictures  almost nude pictures extremely unneccessary use  Any pornographic material available children  especially young  The content questionable items believed inappropriate reviewed taken viewing area majority people believe inappropriate  In conclusion I believe final say displayed children see  As I believe children viewing things able see point life  Some material displayed healthy anyone seeing let alone children  When enter library want enter place theat safe environment children  place worried see hear  So I believe majority people believe something offensive heavily considered removed shelf taken viewing area

5937,2,"I agree with the quote by Katherine Paterson that people do have the right to take a book off the shelves if it's offensive to people. Some books in the libraries are sometimes offensive to a certain religion or race. Katherine Paterson makes a good point that I agree with that if people had the right to take books off shelves, there would not be a single book in the library in the world. In schools, there are some books that are offensive that students are recommeded to read by the state. I believe that libraries should not take books off the shelves if they're found offensive. In the past years, people have been protesting about books that they believe to be offensive by talking about the past like the should not be in the libraries at all. I think these books and movies should be in the libraries, because they help us learn about the past and the dark times of the Students need to know about the reasons of the like slavery and how it is wrong. The people of the future should learn about the and so that another one would be prevented from happening. Students should learn about the because it part of history. Over the years have ban certain types of music like rap, because they found some raps offensive to them. I don't agree with that, because some rappers rap about real life things that are causing problems in People should listen to what the music is saying about how gun violence and gangs are a huge problem in and not be offensive when the swear and talk about someone being shot. Music that can be offensive tell us the problems we have in our lifes that need to be dealt with before it is too late. People often believe that video stores should not be selling movies that some people found offensive, especially about a true story about their idol. I disagree because we learn about the obstacles a person overcame to be successful in life. People would learn how to not give up on themselves and keep going on in their lives.

Some people not be comfortable with reading some books, listening to certain kind of music, watching a certain kind of movie, or reading a certain kind of magazine.

Some people can be offended by books. For example, 'The for religion, people have different beliefs. Music, everybody has different taste in music. There's all kinds of different music out the world. Parent's dont really like children listening to innappropriate music, watching innappropriate movies, or reading innappropriate books that uses profanity, and it causes kids to start talking and thinking like that. There could be innapropriate actions in movies, such as, fighting, sex, profanity, emotional abuseing and physical abuseing actions, that the parents wouldnt want their child to see or learn about. My advice for you is, if your not comfortable with it, and it offends you, avoid it. Go for something else, listen to some other type of music. Watch other types of movies. Read other types of books.

5939,2,"There has been a great debate over if there should be censorship in libraries. Some in a public library would consider some of the books offensive or racist and should be taken off the shelves. Other would say that the books are apart of history and should be apart of the library. In this article you will read why censorship should not be applied to libraries. If you go to a public library, there might be books from a long time ago that sound racist to the living in this century. The who pick up and read the books they think are racist might not know the history behind the book. In the novel, 'The of by uses language that was used in the time period it was written in, purposely to make the readers understand how they talked back then. Now, in some libraries, they have it censored because of the language. The problem with that is, if someone that has never read it picks it up, they will get a different perspective than they could've got if they were reading the real version. Some do research for school, about a novel that would be considered a book that would be censored and write a paper about it. The problem is, they wouldn't get accurate information if the real version is band from all the libraries. Censorship would be taking away the true history that has happened in the past. Some residents might stop going to their public library because of the censorship. Katherine Paterson said in a quote 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' consider some books to be offensive and other books not, but other not agree. Most of the fiction books have lessons or a message behind the story and is not meant to be offensive. There would be great controversy over this if the libraries decide to go with the censorship. So who is to say that a book should be taken off the shelf? There are many reasons why they shouldn't censor the libraries. Some books are historical.

5940,2,Have you ever gone to a library and found a book that you liked the would be kind of offensive to people. I have found books like that but normally those books are the good ones. If it is offensive for your kids to read it you should ask the library to keep your kids away from them. It would be better if you put an age restriction on some of the books so that your kids dont read them. I have seen some teens and kids that like to get into those kinds of books just because they are exciting. But some language can be offensive to you because your kids are reading these kind of books. Taking offensive books out of the library ruins it for some teens and adults that gives them only new book and some of the books about older times are gone. Some people think it would be good to take offensive books out of the library but it would be way better if we just put an age restriction on those books. I am the kind of person that would rather read a book that is alittle offensive because those books get you drawn in and you cant stop reading them. Now some kids shouldnt read the books that are really offensive because they are to young to read books like that but dont take them out completely just have an age retriction for kids. But you can also control what your kid reads and doesnt read if you dont think it is appropriat for them take it away from them and take it back. If you went to the library and found none of the good books you like because they were offensive and had to go how would you feel? I can honestly say I have never read a book that was not a little bit offensive but I like those kinds of books. If they dont read it now they will eventually read it later so let them read it unless u think it is to offensive for them to read then just take it away from them. It would be better to just take it away from your kid then away from everyone that likes to read those kind of books. Even talking to the library about kids not getting offensive books would be better than taking it away from the people who enjoy it. If I was a parent and I got all the books that were offensive but good to you how would you feel about it? I would be mad because I enjoy those books what am i going to read now some of the books I dont enjoy. So if you do anything just take the books away from your kid not all the people who read them. Thats how you can solve all your problems with one simple action that wont affect every person around you and I know no one wants everybody mad at them beacuse they got all of the good books taken away,8902,8903.0,Have ever gone library found book liked would kind offensive people  I found books like normally books good ones  If offensive kids read ask library keep kids away  It would better put age restriction books kids dont read  I seen teens kids like get kinds books exciting  But language offensive kids reading kind books  Taking offensive books library ruins teens adults gives new book books older times gone  Some people think would good take offensive books library would way better put age restriction books  I kind person would rather read book alittle offensive books get drawn cant stop reading  Now kids shouldnt read books really offensive young read books like dont take completely age retriction kids  But also control kid reads doesnt read dont think appropriat take away take back  If went library found none good books like offensive go would feel  I honestly say I never read book little bit offensive I like kinds books  If dont read eventually read later let read unless u think offensive read take away  It would better take away kid away everyone likes read kind books  Even talking library kids getting offensive books would better taking away people enjoy  If I parent I got books offensive good would feel  I would mad I enjoy books going read books I dont enjoy  So anything take books away kid people read  Thats solve problems one simple action wont affect every person around I know one wants everybody mad beacuse got good books taken away

Set up a system were if a certain book has a bad scene or music has bad lyrics make the parent sign a consent form. Yes might be a hassle sometimes but its better then kids rebeling and protesting because that is very close to taking some of our human rights away.

5943,2,"Magazines are meant to give knowledge to those who want to know and Books enjoyment to those who want a story. How be true, there are some subjects that should not be known to children until they are muture enough to handle it. If movies at and video games at stores give age barriers that must be aproved by the parent why is it not done for what on the shelves at the libraray? At you always see the movie you want to watch and then a or some other rating beside it; is used to tell parents that the movie have somthing they don't want thier child to watch whether it be sexual, blood and gore or ilegal actions that shouldn't be copied. Children learn from what they see hear and read. If theres are no restrictions they see it as okay and that nothing is wrong with it since there is nothing to stop them. books are just as terrifiing as movies when it comes to what they imagine movies give the picture while children are to imagine it when they read.it'@CAPS4 most likly sure no parent wants them to be seeing or thinking of sex, drinking or gun fights especially when they don't know the consequences of it. Their are also magazines that if not given at the right age could make them paranoid about the world around them. there is information about the wars and nuclear bombings and holocoust that had a child read would be struck with fear. some books about dieseses could make them worry to much about being clean and devolop severe and not have a healthy, and care free childhood. Children are not supposed to worry about politics or diesese and when they learn things too early, it could make them terribly worried and paranoid thoughout their life. music can be a dangous tool to a child as well, although at first thought it is to be enjoyment for the ears, most music is made to send a message. The current pop radio staions give out catchy songs but will give the hints of sex, drugs, and drinking. If the puplic can give that kind of music, what can be found at a library could be much worse for kids to hear. Music also can change ones emotions, for better or worse. Songs about life being hard or losing everyting can hurt a childs mind as well. Explicit songs like '@CAPS4.E.X.' are a perfect example of how bad songs can be and how far it can change a childs mind. The library is meant to be a place for enjoyment and give knowledge, but their are things that should not be taught or told about until a certain age.

5944,2,"Why do people go to the library? They study and read and check out books and I'm sure there are more things. So, is it right to take certain materials away because some find them inappropriate? Personally, I think that as humans, we have the right to read and study whatever we want to. There are many reading materials that can be found offensive to certain people, but there has to be a line drawn. Some people find certain books extremely offensive while someone else get a lot out of it. And you wonder, 'who decides if the books are offensive or not?' thats a great question. I can guarantee that someone could find at least one thing in every book that offends some else in the world. It would be way to controversial to try to eliminate all materials that are offensive or inappropriate. When you go to the library, it's usually for a specific material. You expect to find it there. You dont want to go to the library, search for a book, realize it's not there, then start the process all over again. You want to go to one place and get all of your materials. If libraries started eliminating certain books, music, movies, and magazines because some people thought they were too offensive, people would run into the same problem all the time. Another problem is created from taking books off the shelves. How do you find information on the topics that are considered inappropriate or offensive? People can't expect others to just be naive on certain topics. It is a human's right to be able to read, listen, study, or watch whatever he or she would like. I believe that no one should be able to blatenly take books off of shelves in libraries.

5945,2,"Offensiveness is exaggerated all the time. Nobody knows what being offensive is, and nobody knows what being nice is. We just all have our own opinions and ideas about things. I've seen magazines and movies that can be offensive, but the way I see them is different. If they dont portray being offensive throughout the movie or magazine, then are they being offensive at all? People these days see a movie with a black person in and automatically think that its being racist torwards black people. Its not though, its just an actor doing his job, and if it is a racist movie then you have to remember he can choose whether he wants to act in that movie, so he must like the movie he's starring in or he wouldnt do it. Everything is already messed up in the world today anyways. The media is already terrible and contains who knows what anymore. To try to figure out what in the media is offensive and what's not would leave you with nothing. Everyone thinks at least one thing in each piece of media is offensive, I gaurantee it. So by the time we would have all the media removed there would be none left. So, to be asked whether certain materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive is absurd. Like before, nobody knows what offensive is. We just voice our opinions about things and hope that they make a difference. We all don't think alike, or we would all be the same, and then there wouldn't be any controversy in the world. To be in a world without controversy would be like being in a world where nothin mattered, not even If controversy hadn't arose then where would our constitution be, and our amendments?

5946,2,"Many say that by a book or a movies or even a magazine being offensive that it should automatically be removed from the shelf. Not everybody has that way of thinking when it comes down to race and religion. Some agree but others dont agree. I am here today to explain to the my three main points of view in this arguement. I am going to talk about are different points of viewing, personal observation, what I feel about the decision. When you look at something you should have a open minded about what is being said instead of being to quick to jumop to conclusions. Not everybod does get offended by it but just because one person gets offended by it means that it should be banned from the shelf. By taking it away people will not be able to experience it for themselves. It is not that it is wrong to get offended by it but that you should always be opened minded to arguements no matter if you agree or disagree. I personally have watched a movie called and the movie is about different races all in a wrinting class and they experience life about all of them. Many in the movie do get offended but they all do come to a open minded conclusion and learn to love one another and to make a difference in each of there lives. By doing something better instead of living in the past. Another thing that I saw on the news a couple years ago was that students were in a class and they were reading a book and there parents complained about the book so they tried to have it removed so they would no longer have to read it. That is not being open minded if have to deal with learning about slavery and things and be open minded about it then why cant everybody else in the world be open minded about all the things that have happened in the world. My opinion of the argument is that we have to learn about the past but that doesnt mean that we need to live in the past. Living in the past doesnt help make a difference in the world or make a change. I feel that everybody should have a open minded towards everything. In history class or even english the things that we read you really need a open mind towards it. I also feel that not having a open mind towards the things that you read means that you are not ready for a change, you are still living in the past. As I said in this argument that a person should be open minded when it comes down to reading and learning about the past. Learning about it and wanting to make a differnce so that you wont have to go through the samething as the others. By learning about it you would want to make a differnce in this world and come together so we can all be one.

5947,2,"There are many genres of books and many of those books in each genre. Libraries often contain endless collections of books, movies, and magazines on their shelves for people to read and enjoy from but some but material is only meant for certain age groups. In my opinion, libraries should still keep those books for the people who want to read them but there should be rules about who can check them out and who cannot. One way that libraries can have these books while still keeping unwanted eyes away is by putting these mature books in a restricted section of the library. By doing this only adults will be able to view these books. Since it is a restricted section it will be watched so that minors won't be able to sneak in. Another way that the library could still keep the books without worrying that they could be seen by the wrong eyes is by having an age requirement for the shelves that hold these books. With this rule people under the age requirement won't be able to checkout these books. The restricted section idea could also be added to this for extra security. The two ideas mentioned earlier, in my opinion, would come to great use for libraries that hold these books but even these rules wouldn't be enough for some books. There are some books out there that are extremely mature and it would be very bad for a kid who would just happen to stumble across one. In that case, books like that should be removed from all public libraries. There are always going to be books in this world that some parents are not going to approve for there children especially since different parents have different views of what is inappropriate and what is not. I think that having a restricted section in public libraries along with an age requirement to view this material is a good idea to go by.

In our society today, language and nudity have become more expressed then in the Libraries need to be aware of the children. Libraries need child sections, adult sections, and family sections. Some libraries have sections for kids and sections for adults but some libraries mix them together. This can be a bad idea. A child at the age of or under could read an adult books and quote this book infront of their family or a teacher. Parents don't want their children to see or hear adult literature because its not right for a child to see it. So libraries need to make a child section and make sure the children are in their section. The section would be for children and under. Libraries have more adult books then they do children books. These books need to be in their own section so that adults can know where to find them and so children do not find them. Most adult books have language that parents don't want their child to read or even hear. Movies are worse. They can show people things that they might not want to know about. Books could change a child's life and it could be a good life or a bad life. Lastly, libraries should have a family secton. This section would have books that kids and parents can read together. The books would have apropriate language and have fun stories. The family could read them together without worrying about bad language or reading about nudity.

5950,2,"In every library there are many books that kids could find interesting. Question is are all of them censored enough for children. Some books such as, heath books show uneeded pictures of nude bodies. Some magazines in the libraries give unproper ideas as to what is cool in the teenage world. Should health books, magazines or even some novels be allowed in our public library. There are many good books in a library, but question is should some people consider more about what is presented in each book. Health books could be considered a huge concern to some people and their children. Health books often show pictures of nude bodies to give examples of what the a disease look like. Theses books often present articles about sickness and disease. Some of these articles have pictures to go along with them that are sometimes very graphic for young children. Even though, health books are often well needed for reseach in a library, should they be taken out? Libraries could even prevent young children from picking them up by simply moving them to the back. This would make them still available to ask for, but takes away the risk for children. In many magazines there are articles and pictures presented that are considered cool to some teenagers. Not all of these pictures are considered cool to teenage parents though. Some parents are very protective over thier child, but when a kid goes to school and looks through magazies for girls in bikinis there isn't much they can do. Sport and other sports magazines can sometimes offend parents by the way some famous role models are appearing in these magazines. Librarians need to watch who they are handing a magazine to when they know it has things in it that can get a kid in trouble. Everyone loves a good novel every once in awhile. There are various kinds of novels and many of them are quite popular to young teenagers. Young teenage girls are always reading romance novels that could consist of sexual content. Twlight is a very good example of a popular book that presents sex scenes. In some books it can be very detailed as to what is happening. Teenagers are not stupid, they know what is happening in the sex scene. It isn't only in romance novels that graphic scenes appear though. Many guys can read a mystery or thriller book that contains scene of violence. In most thriller books there is contexts of bloody killings. People really need to watch what their kid is reading because sometimes it can give kids bad ideas. Many libraries don't watch what they are putting out to their public. Most librarians are familiar with what kind of books have content that shouldn't be read by children. I am not saying that all of these books should be taken out of libraries. I am simply saying that in some cases the librarians are to blame because they are the ones letting your kids check out the books. There are many good books out there that contain the wrong context for little children, but there are ways you can prevent a child from reading them.

5951,2,"Censorship in libraries is a very tender subject when it is brought up to parents, but as a student, I think it should be. Censorship in libraries should be minimal. If you do not want music or books that you believe are offensive, then do not check them out. Some people like that form of entertainment, and it is their right to attain it. Books should not be taken off the shelves simply because parents think it is inappropriate for a certain age group. Personally, when I go to the library, with the intent of checking out a book, music, or some other form of entertainment offered there, the first thing I do is browse the titles and cover. I know the saying '@CAPS1't judge a book by its cover,' but we all do. If we find a book with an intriguing picture on the front, we will either stear clear of it, and books like it, or become more interested. It is in my experience that the titles that parents would like to ban have inappropriate names, and, if we bother to pick up the book and look at the cover, most likely have a very good image. It is then clear and easy to avoid those types of literature. Observation skills are all that's needed. If parents are worried about their children checking out the wrong books, then teach then what the wrong books are, and how to avoid them, instead of taking them off the shelf, thereby limiting what the rest of us have to choose from. The quote by states it perfectly. If we were all to take books off the shelves that we do not think are appropriate for children, siblings, or someone else we look after and care for, then there would never be any books. I find that most offensive material is directed at a certain party of individuals. If you were to find a that material to be directed at you, it is natural to reject it. The concern is that children will listen to material that is by their party and offending another, thereby making some form of predudice against that group. Again, education is the only way you can abhor this. You have to teach your children that it is not respectable to treat other people like that, and that prejudice is, in every form, wrong. There are several solutions to this problem. For smaller children, I would recommend allowing parents access to library accounts, so they can monitor what books their children are checking out, and restrict access to things they personally believe to be inappropriate, so they are not able to check those forms of things out. For young adults, I think the only solution would be to teach them what is appropraite and what is not. They are almost adults. They are close to being out on their own. They should be given the responsiblity to make their own choices and live with those actions and whatever come with them. Taking books off the shelves is pointless. If your child is intent of attaining that material, they will. Instead we need to educate them in what is right and wrong. Limiting the selection of everyone simply because a parent thinks it is inappropriate is unjust. An opinion of one, or a few, persons should not effect the whole body of people that utilize a library's services.",8924,8925.0,Censorship libraries tender subject brought parents  student  I think  Censorship libraries minimal  If want music books believe offensive  check  Some people like form entertainment  right attain  Books taken shelves simply parents think inappropriate certain age group  Personally  I go library  intent checking book  music  form entertainment offered  first thing I browse titles cover  I know saying   CAPSt judge book cover    If find book intriguing picture front  either stear clear  books like  become interested  It experience titles parents would like ban inappropriate names   bother pick book look cover  likely good image  It clear easy avoid types literature  Observation skills s needed  If parents worried children checking wrong books  teach wrong books  avoid  instead taking shelf  thereby limiting rest us choose  The quote states perfectly  If take books shelves think appropriate children  siblings  someone else look care  would never books  I find offensive material directed certain party individuals  If find material directed  natural reject  The concern children listen material party offending another  thereby making form predudice group  Again  education way abhor  You teach children respectable treat people like  prejudice  every form  wrong  There several solutions problem  For smaller children  I would recommend allowing parents access library accounts  monitor books children checking  restrict access things personally believe inappropriate  able check forms things  For young adults  I think solution would teach appropraite  They almost adults  They close  They given responsiblity make choices live actions whatever come  Taking books shelves pointless  If child intent attaining material   Instead need educate right wrong  Limiting selection everyone simply parent thinks inappropriate unjust  An opinion one   persons effect whole body people utilize library s services 
5952,2,"If censorship is implemented in public libraries, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us'. I believe that although some materials be found offensive to some people, they should not be censored to everyone. First, no one person has the right to say to another, 'you cannot read this because I find it offensive'. That is an infringement on our rights, as Because the issue we are discussing is in public and government funded libraries, this infringment is doubly worse. Every person finds different things offensive, and as Katherine Paterson said, 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf [...] then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think this quote shows that unless information sources such as libraries are entirely inclusive, they run the risk of losing much of the information they offer. The purpose of a library is to offer all types of information to the public, and once one starts censoring, where does it draw the line? At books with sexual content? Or books with religous themes? Or perhaps all non-fiction books dealing with theories not accepted the dominant religion, Second, If there is a great disagreement between a library and the people living around it about a book or theme represented there, the opposed books or themes need not be removed, but a warning could be posted on the cover telling patrons that it contains controversial ideas or information. Or the library could move them over to their own section, while still making the materials available for public use. Third, no one is forcing anyone to come to the library and read a book. If a patron does not like a book's message or content, he or she has the power to put it down. Every has the free will to do so, and it is an insult to us and to our nation that we need the library to censor itself so that we do not have to exercise that free will. In many southern states through the sixties, the book To a was banned because it was pro-@CAPS7 Now we recognize that as an emberassment, that we were once so ignorant. I believe that library censorship will take the same path, and we will one day look back at all of the information people were prevented from learning, and say '@CAPS9 did we let that happen?'.",8926,8927.0,If censorship implemented public libraries  no books left shelf us   I believe although materials found offensive people  censored everyone  First  one person right say another  you read I find offensive   That infringement rights  Because issue discussing public government funded libraries  infringment doubly worse  Every person finds different things offensive  Katherine Paterson said  if I right remove book shelf    also exactly right everyone else  And books left shelf us   I think quote shows unless information sources libraries entirely inclusive  run risk losing much information offer  The purpose library offer types information public  one starts censoring  draw line  At books sexual content  Or books religous themes  Or perhaps nonfiction books dealing theories accepted dominant religion  Second  If great disagreement library people living around book theme represented  opposed books themes need removed  warning could posted cover telling patrons contains controversial ideas information  Or library could move section  still making materials available public use  Third  one forcing anyone come library read book  If patron like book s message content  power put  Every free  insult us nation need library censor exercise free  In many southern states sixties  book To banned pro  CAPS Now recognize emberassment  ignorant  I believe library censorship take path  one day look back information people prevented learning  say   CAPS let happen

5954,2,"Do books need removed because they are offensive? I say yes but some other people say no. I have a few reason why I think they should be. Yes I think books should be taken off the shelves if they offend someone with a good reason. If someone just wants a book removed for no reason then that shouldnt have to happen. Books, music, magazines, movies, etc. should be left alone unless they are extremely offensive. There are people out there that just want to make a scene. They do that by causing someone to get mad even though its just something little. If someone thinks a book is offensive they should have a really good reason. If the reason is, 'I just don't like the book so it needs to be taken off the shelf.', then it should be left where it is at. If the reason is, '@CAPS1 that way and that book makes me feel like people will make fun of me', then it should be removed. People do have the right to their own feelings. Most of our reasons would be like I'm black and that offends me. I don't think that is a very good reason because some of the books like that are educational. If a book is educational, even though it offends someone, it has a reason to be on the shelf. The books that are in libraries are usually there for a purpose. There are different areas of the library. If one certain section offends you then don't go there. It is your own choice of what book you want to read so if there is a book that offends you then don't get it.

5955,2,"Should books, movies and magazines be censored in libraries? Who is to say that a book is offensive? Many write to express their thoughts and feelings, is there any way that could be offensive? Firstly, there are many different genres that books come in throughout libraries. If you walk in a library today, you can go from nonfiction to fiction or also to sci fi. There is no certain way to writing and therefore it should never be a crime to make your own book from what you want it to be. What would you say if your favorite book was offensive to younger readers and was banned from your local library? Many of us would rant and not want to come back because of this new offense. But many cities wonder if we should actually censor the books in our libraries. Who chooses what the citizens want to read? If you want to read nonfiction or fiction you can, no other human being should be allowed to stop you. Also, many school's libraries have many different varities of books and genres.By taking away some of the books and subtracting from the many popular genres, we are then taking away the student's desire to read more.Therefore we should not take away their right to read what they want to read. School's would be in a hassle if we took genres of books away from them. In highschool many teachers provide the class with different books for different projects. If we took that right away, than the students would not be completing their highschool years with as much as previous students had. Lastly, from my own experience I remember when I got to go to the library by myself to pick up a book. If there were certain books censored than I wouldn't have ever been able to read from what I wanted to read. Why take away freedom from our citizens? Why begin to change the way we're doing things?

What would you say to your son? Books, magazines, music and movies have changed tremendously over the generations and not for the better. The music young people listen to today is vulgar and offensive. The language and concepts used in the movies today are inappropriate and should not be used in the materials. Libraries and book stores should review what is going out on their shelves more then what they are doing now. Not all the materials found in the library are offensive. But a great number of them are. I think that the children of generation have been exposed to concepts and materials previous generations have not been. Now, the libraries can do something about Libraries should moniter what children are reading and being exposed to. Certian magazines should be taken off the shelf to prevent exposure to the vulgar and offensive readings to children.

5957,2,"My views of if we should censor our libraries is, not doing it. If we censor our libraries there will be very many people that like a certain categorgy of books, and they would get removed. Everyone should get to read, or watch what ever they prefer. If we take out what we think isn't a good book, or movie then it would only be fair to take out books that those people don't like also. Every book is written for a special taste in books and some people like it, but not everybody. It's not fair though to take the books away from the people that do like those kind of books. If everyone had the right to take out a book they didn't think was a good book, then there would hardly be any books at all in the libraries. Some authors wouldn't like it also, because maybe they only like writing about certain things. If we don't allow that type of writing the author would get mad and stop writing books for the people to read. Most people have a preference for what type of book they like to read whether it be, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, or even a biography. They should be able to read those books, because they like to read them. I believe the same thing with music, movies, and magazines. There are all kinds of different movies that some people might not find suitable for their children, or for anyone to watch at all. Then again not everybody thinks that way, so should be able to watch what they want. With music if people don't like the music they can make their children buy a edited version of the album so it's not saying bad things in the songs. Then magazines have all kinds of different articles and stories in them that some people enjoy reading about and some could care less about. The way I feel is also my opinion someone else could feel completely different. That's their decision on how they feel on this topic.

5960,2,"Censorship Censorship is big across the world. Many people believe that there are too many offensive videos, books, magazines, etc., out there. But does this mean we have to take it away? Everyone has different views on what they concider bad and good. We wonder if it would be a good idea to take profanity and other bad things away, but we arn't sure if it will solve the problem. In my opinion, I believe that we shouldn't take it off the shelf. If someone is really that intrested in reading it, then they should be allowed. I know that we don't want our generation looking at terrible materials at a young age, therefore, we should be able to censor that material, and still have a copy of the original. Just think, if we had a censored copy and original copy of every material, it would have to be up to you to decided which one is best suited for you. From what we are beginning to see around the world, items are being exposed at younger ages. If we want this to continue and be an everyday thing, then we souldn't have a censored copy. I would think that a parent would be intelligent enough to stop a child from picking up a bad material. Which brings me to my next point, age limit.

Most books are based off of some sort of truth or something the author went through, so nobody has the right to take away what an author writes. If our society allowed certain books to be censored some of the best books would eventually get thrown out. '@CAPS1 of is a fanstatic book, but in some places they want to censor it. Why is that? Because some places view '@CAPS1 of as a degrading book because of its racial slurs and connection to the real world. In '@CAPS1 of it reveals how life was back when negros were slaves and women were property. Some societies frown upon this. '@CAPS1 of isn't the only book that would be censored, some of the best works would eventually be censored. Pretend that society let one book be censored. How long would it be till libraries and book stores no long held any books? One action is the first step in a chain reaction. In this case, the chain reaction would let censoring books go to far and destroy them. Also, censoring book could crush the imaganation of a writer, and an imaganation is one of the most powerful things we can own. Last of all, some books are hard to grasp, but if society were to throw out these books then how are we to learn from them? No person is old to pick up a book and read it. So what the difference if an eighty year old picks up a book thats censored than a twelve year old? Nothing in age makes a difference when it involves reading. Apparently reading is a powerful thing, or people wouldn't try to take away our freedom to do so. Censoring books is completly wrong.

Ask the libarain if they are another one back behind the counter or if they would happend to know where another book just like that would be at so she can take it with here on her vaction so she doesnt get bored. Another reason would be go online and there are apps that you can get to read books online and you can find any book that you want to read that best suits you. You can print it off if you have that many papers but if you have like a ipod or a ipad you can just take that with you and read it right from there. Or if you are in acess with a computer and you get bored just hop on that and read that. A good reason would be is to go ask that person if you can check it out this week cause you need to read it for something and dont wand to get bored with what you are doing.

5967,2,"A dumber society, a worse society, an author's voice being taken away, and a society that cannot find happiness. These are all effects of what happens when you censor literature, and it is why I believe that no matter the circumstances, literature, be it in books, music, magazines, or any other form of expressing an opinion, should never be censored. As a collective group of individuals, we can always learn something from every one book. Books like '@CAPS1 can provide us insight into societies that we would not want to live in, but insight into how not to enter into a society like this. No matter what, most books in this world are going to offend at least one person, so if we follow the concept of censoring books, then we would end up with no books to read, as stated in her quote. The ability to read whatever book you want is a fundamental one to learning more about other societies, as well as our own. If more books were to become censored, the world would be a much worse place. Our children would have less material to go over, books would only highlight our own society, not some other society we can not start down the path of. Additionally, the banning of specific books makes them more intriguing to some readers to read. If a book is banned, it is going to quite possibly have more people trying to find a way to read it, which would achieve the opposite result of what the 'banner' (for lack of a better term) wanted it to achieve. The less books that are banned, the better off our society will be today and later down the road. Without any books being banned, our society opens up to new ideas that can either improve our current society, as well as to see how we do not want our society to be. '@CAPS1 is regarded as being one of the more influential books of the despite having been a banned book at times since it was written. Being able to read '@CAPS1 gives readers an insight into what life would be like in a society without books, a possible society of the future. This enables us to be able to see the road we could be heading down as a civilization, and it is especially applicable now with the advent of the and advancement of the television. One other point I would like to make on the subject of banning books is that it takes away the author's voice. Each and every one of us, being humans that walk this have the same right to be able to have a voice, and to say whatever our hearts desire us to say. Banning a book would take away that voice, take away what that person has to say, and that, in my humble opinion, is a very bad, and very wrong thing to do. If a person does not have a voice, how can we expect him or her to be a contributing member to society? If we censor a person's voice, that person's contributions go by the wayside, unnoticed by many people. How would you feel if your voice was taken away? We live in a world where nobody should have their voice taken away, and historically, banning books has been a way of doing this. Without certain books, we would not be able to learn as much about the outside world. For example, if there is a book the government of our nation does not want us to read, the learning that could come from that book is lost, and we fail to pick up what could be crucial knowledge. What if your favorite book was censored? Everything you have learned from that book would suddenly leave your brain, as you would have never read the book in the first place. Books teach us things about us, they teach us things about the world, and all books have some sort of benefit to reading them. By censoring a book, you take away the possibility of this benefit to the reader, and you make it impossible to gain this benefit. Additionally, you could be limiting the happiness that comes with reading a specific book, which is something that a person should never have taken away from them, the ability to be happy, which is truly all most of us want in life. As you can see, censorship can have many, many negative effects on society, including, but not limited to, a society that does not learn as much, society not realizing good or bad ideas, and the limiting of a person's voice, a person's knowledge, or a person's happiness. These are all effects of censorship, and they should speak for themselves as to why book censorship is bad. But if that is not enough to convince some people, I will conclude this essay with a question.

5968,2,"Books are an essential part of learning and development. They contain thought-provoking stories, ideas, and factual information that are ideal for a person's development. Without books in libraries, the world would lose intellectual thinking, and people would lose the true meaning of life. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed because it threatens authors freedom of speech, takes away a reader's individual choice, and would ultimately lead to more unneeded censorship. Every citizen is entitled to their freedom of speech, including authors. Whether an author writes a factual book about the human body or a fictional book about wizards, the literary work is written for a purpose. Some adults say, '@CAPS2 book is very inappropriate for minors! It should not be in the library!' Of course the book is probably inappropriate for children, but is because the author wrote it for adults. If book was banned, then an adult who wanted to read it now is limited to what the censor deems appropriate. When someone wants a booked banned, it stops someone else from reading it. takes away a reader's right of individual choice. Just like freedom of speech, the right of individual choice is something everyone is entitled to. Anyone should be able to walk in a library and read the book they want without anyone telling them it is not allowed. Censorship of certain materials would take inevitable right away. There will always be conflict, dissagreement, and arguments, but censorship is not the answer. Once one book is found offensive, someone finds another and another. chain of events is something that has to be cut short, and idealy not allowed at all. The main reason material is banned is because it is found offensive to someone. Well, just because a few people do not agree with the ideas of a certain book does not mean that it should be banned. Everyone has different views, and if everyone banned something they did not like, we would have nothing left. Overall, the materials found in a library are extremely important for one's learning and development of opinions. Censorship of such materials is something that hurts people in many ways. It takes away an author's freedom of speech and does not acknowledge the hard work the author put into the literary work. Also, a person's freedom of choice is threatened because they are no longer allowed to choose certain books or materials. Lastly, censorship only leads to more and more censorship.

5970,2,"Books, music, movies and magzines are materials found on the shelves of any setting. They all have a purpose and reasoning for why they made it to the shelves. That is why I'm sometimes thankful for the novels and authors choosen by librarians. If there wasn't books, movies and music racist by any means I would not know the views or perception of what people thought of not only my race but my ancesters. As a child in through fifth grade, I was always told that writing was always a way of expressing feelings whether it turn into a book or a poem and eventually a song, but to criticize someone for their way of writing just isn't fare nor is it appropriate. I'm not a author and don't plan on being but looking from their perspective I would find that insalting. For example lets say you work at and you make a burger for a customer; they later come back and complain that it is not good and that maybe the employee should be fired. To me that just seems wrong on so many levels. Authors want constructive critizism not to be taking off shelves. Like the old saying '@CAPS1 mans trash, is another mans treasure'. Libraries are filled with opinions, facts and expressions and just because a couple of people decide that they find a book offensive that should not dictate whether a book, magazine or tape be displayed or not. If life worked that way with people many of us would not be alive right about now. Book clubs are always avaliable to express your feelings on how a book was whether you enjoyed it or thought it was the worse book you ever read. As a toddler I loved taking visits to the it felt like a reward to me. Checking out books, movies and we're always the best part. As I grew up I hardly ever went to the unless it was for a school purpose. Most of the times it's for historical projects that were set in a time before I was even born. So to find information about certain races and people whether they are viewed in a positive light or negative it is always helpful. If people found everything negative offensive then the world would only be seen as a pretty picture. In my feelings about the views on censorship in libraries are very clear, taking a book, magazine, and movie off of the wall that someone fabricated would be unruly. as quoted once before '@CAPS1 mans trash, is another mans treasure'.",8962,8963.0,Books  music  movies magzines materials found shelves setting  They purpose reasoning made shelves  That I m sometimes thankful novels authors choosen librarians  If nt books  movies music racist means I would know views perception people thought race ancesters  As child fifth grade  I always told writing always way expressing feelings whether turn book poem eventually song  criticize someone way writing nt fare appropriate  I m author nt plan looking perspective I would find insalting  For example lets say work make burger customer  later come back complain good maybe employee fired  To seems wrong many levels  Authors want constructive critizism taking shelves  Like old saying   CAPS mans trash  another mans treasure   Libraries filled opinions  facts expressions couple people decide find book offensive dictate whether book  magazine tape displayed  If life worked way people many us would alive right  Book clubs always avaliable express feelings book whether enjoyed thought worse book ever read  As toddler I loved taking visits felt like reward  Checking books  movies re always best part  As I grew I hardly ever went unless school purpose  Most times s historical projects set time I even born  So find information certain races people whether viewed positive light negative always helpful  If people found everything negative offensive world would seen pretty picture  In feelings views censorship libraries clear  taking book  magazine  movie wall someone fabricated would unruly  quoted   CAPS mans trash  another mans treasure

To me books should be something that many people can find funny or something they have learned, not something that is mean and hurtfull.

Sometimes just a few people are offended by something but they get what they want, even when no one else thinks it is an issue. What happened to majority rules? That is how our society was set up. Material in libraries should not be removed if they are found offensive. If someone is offended by a topic, they should not automatically get the right to have it removed. If you are offended by something, do not read it. What is harder, egnoring something or trying to get in banned because you find it offensive? It would be unfair to take something away from everyone else because one person found it offensive. If people could do that there would not be anything left in any public library. Removing items from libraries, because a minority of people find it offensive, is unfair the rest of the people. People have the right to read or see what they want. It also infringes on the right of free speech. Whoever wrote the article or book would loose a very important right. If multiple people found something to be offensive it should be taken into consideration but not automatically removed. If many people are cerious about having something removed, there should be a vote. The libraries could also randomly ask people if they found a topic to be offensive or if it sould be removed. That is how many things are done in the If most people think it should be removed or find it offensive then it would be okay to remove it. Material in libraries should not be removed if they are found offensive. People do not have the right to take things away from others. They also do not have the right to take away someone's freedom of speech. If it is a skechy topic, take a vote and/or polling to see if it should be removed.

5973,2,"No, I dont think books, and movies should come off the shelf but some music should. There not alot thats bad about book in school or pulic places with books. But none of the movies should come down. Some of the music is kinda bad but not all of it is some people just make a big deal out of it when it shouldnt be. And magazines there nothin wrong with those the pictures and word there nothing it hurts. Little kids might get some of the bad stuff but anyone older is going to hear ir or see it at one piont in there life. And if it music there going to hear it from almost anywhere they go.Even if it good or bad. Movies can be bad for younger children but not for middle school and high school kids.

5974,2,"No, i do not feel that libraries should take the offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., off the shelves. Because alot of those things teach us about life situations. Even though they might be offensive they should still keep them because if you really think about it those things will help you in the end. For example lets say there is a book on a teen girl that is sexually active with the whole school and she catches an std. The book end up helping teen girls out so they will not be sexual active with the whole school or even alot partners. And they will think like well if i have so many partners i end up catching an std and harming their selves. And if the school really wants to help the students make better choices they should keep things that will show them the right and wrong choices in life. Now I can see if they are elementary kids the things should be removed. Because kids that are in elementary should not be reading offensive books. Because younger kids look at things different. The children say well if the characters do it in the book so can I. And that will be a bad influence on the kids. So I also feel that the elementary kids shouldn't have offensive books for the fact that they are to young to read books watch movies and look at magazines that are going to be offensive. So in my opinion i think only middle school and high schools should have offensive books because thay end up saving young aduls lives and helping teens make better desicions in their lives. Maybe have things that show sexual activity, gang violence, all real life situations. But you can make sure the books are not that bad. Because their are books, movies, magazines, and etc., that have a little of those things that will be fine. I just do not like the idea that people say it's 'offensive'. So i just want to let the schools hear my opinion on the topic. Because I am a student that is in high school and i like reading the books that are offensive because they show you problems that will happen if you make wrong choices, and even show you real life things. Just because the schools want the books, movies, magazines and etc off the shelves does not mean the students do. So if I was the school I would like to hear the students voices and opinions. And I hope that the schools really do take time to think about their desicion about taking offensive books, movies, magazines and etc., off the library shelves.",8970,8971.0,No  feel libraries take offensive books  movies  magazines  etc  shelves  Because alot things teach us life situations  Even though might offensive still keep really think things help end  For example lets say book teen girl sexually active whole school catches std  The book end helping teen girls sexual active whole school even alot partners  And think like well many partners end catching std harming selves  And school really wants help students make better choices keep things show right wrong choices life  Now I see elementary kids things removed  Because kids elementary reading offensive books  Because younger kids look things different  The children say well characters book I  And bad influence kids  So I also feel elementary kids nt offensive books fact young read books watch movies look magazines going offensive  So opinion think middle school high schools offensive books thay end saving young aduls lives helping teens make better desicions lives  Maybe things show sexual activity  gang violence  real life situations  But make sure books bad  Because books  movies  magazines  etc  little things fine  I like idea people say s offensive   So want let schools hear opinion topic  Because I student high school like reading books offensive show problems happen make wrong choices  even show real life things  Just schools want books  movies  magazines etc shelves mean students  So I school I would like hear students voices opinions  And I hope schools really take time think desicion taking offensive books  movies  magazines etc  library shelves 
5975,2,"I think that books that are tear up should be removed and bring new books to the children so they will have books to read. Music, movies,and magazines should not be removed because how are we going to listen or read to the child when he or she grows up. But they need to put some new books,magazines, movies and music so they could understand what they are reading, listening and watching what they see. Don't burn books,music,movies and magazines because if you burn the books,music,movies and magazines they won't learn how to read,listen to music and watch a movie that has words that they need to learn or understand. If the child is like about birth till years old you can put out flashcards or read them a book, if their like a month old they will point out the words and if they are till adults they will read a book. If your child can't read help them out by reading to them,they might know or understand how to read. Kids,teens and adults like to read. But don't take the books,music,movies or magazines because they might not learn how to read. If they have like a cd tape inside of the book give them a tape recording and headphones so they will point out the words and read the book to theirselves. If you and the child have a library card they could get books,music and movies or if there is a bookmobile you could get the same things there too. Children need to learn how to read because it could help the brain get motivated and smater so they will learn this at school, or if they have a job they need to learn how to read",8972,8973.0,I think books tear removed bring new books children books read  Music  movies  magazines removed going listen read child grows  But need put new books  magazines  movies music could understand reading  listening watching see  Do nt burn books  music  movies magazines burn books  music  movies magazines wo nt learn read  listen music watch movie words need learn understand  If child like birth till years old put flashcards read book  like month old point words till adults read book  If child ca nt read help reading  might know understand read  Kids  teens adults like read  But nt take books  music  movies magazines might learn read  If like cd tape inside book give tape recording headphones point words read book theirselves  If child library card could get books  music movies bookmobile could get things  Children need learn read could help brain get motivated smater learn school  job need learn read
5976,2,"Most books that are chosen at a local library for children is ok. In a library there are sections you would have to go by. There's a childrens section and an adult section for higher levels of reading. When reading you concentrate on what you r reading so i feel that if a child is old enough to chose a book they should be concerned about what their about to or going to read. I feel that books is a healthy start for readers. What I'm tring to say is that readings books helps you reading level approve. At certain times yes it does matter what your reading. For instance if you child (ages comes home with an adult book your going to wonder why their able to get books around that environment. If i could take the books from certain stands i wouldn't. Reading is one of my most enjoying hobbies.I also love listening to music, and watching movies. Now there are plenty of music and movies i would love to take away. I mean i love rap but most children get so caught up into learning about what wrong then learning how to do what's right. For example a grader might not be as good when it comes to reading because they barely does any work, but sit he/she in front of a rap song or anything that has nothing to do with school they'll know every word. In life now a days there books and other equipment you would love for a child to have. For instance alphebet books on learning how to read,@CAPS1's and grade movies. Every choice you child makes on rether their making a good learning choice you shold be there to back them up. Offensive languages and writing doesn't influence a child to pick wrong books,listen to garbage music, or watch the movies you and others influence your child to be a better and wise thinkers like others taught you. In closing i would like to say there are many things you could choose that would make a change. As much as i read books as a teen sum offensive won't hurt at all. Through the years your going to learn about offensive things and your going to have to be wise about them. You can't depend on others to pick you up everytime you fall make a choice on your own and learn from it.

5977,2,"I don't think books should be taken off of shelves just because they might have offensive language in them. People should read the backs of the books, magazines, etc. when checking out or buying a book. I can see where little children can get ahold of some books that are a little vulgar for them to read, but that is the responsibility of a librarian or a salesperson to keep those books or magazines away from them. If you have books that are inappropriate for little kids, keep them out of reach. Hide them somewhere that adults have to ask to buy a copy of it. I think that books should be allowed to have any kind of language in it, on the account of our right to free speech. Who cares if little kids read vulgar words, as long as they don't repeat them it should be okay.",8976,8977.0,I nt think books taken shelves might offensive language  People read backs books  magazines  etc  checking buying book  I see little children get ahold books little vulgar read  responsibility librarian salesperson keep books magazines away  If books inappropriate little kids  keep reach  Hide somewhere adults ask buy copy  I think books allowed kind language  account right free speech  Who cares little kids read vulgar words  long nt repeat okay
